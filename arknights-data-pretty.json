          "description": "First, there are a few indistinct silhouettes. Soon, a dazzling light. Gradually, the light grows distant and rises to the sky, leaving behind bright blotches. Not long after, these points of light themselves speed far away, and all that remains is a meaningless, jet black.\nYou remember those blotches are celestial bodies, every one. You remember the home of the stars is called the cosmos.\nThen immediately, your sight abruptly grows clear. Sleek metal. A sealed room. A clear window forms your third eye—through the window, you gaze at a colossal grey sphere, and in the center of that megastructure no normal mind could comprehend, it quietly awaits its birth father...\nYou suddenly feel a kind of movement. A fluid wets your vision. You begin to seek this emotion's root. You see a child's birth. It is your child. A brand new fate, a soul entrusted... But against that yawning megastructure, how insignificant a life of such miniscule proportions it is.\nYou return to the now, and gaze at those engineering ships, big and small. You, the mathematician, quickly make a ridiculous comparison—even the smallest ship among them is thousands of times larger than an infant of mankind.\nBut you have all done it. Starting from the antiquity of antiquity, starting with fire or a hunt, you have come all the way to today.\nYou are immensely proud. By some mysterious mechanism, you feel this pride as if it is yours, upon which more information pours into your mind. You remember your own identity. You realize that you are the designer of that artificial satellite. And after such a long journey in subspace, you finally greet the moment of its completion with your very own eyes.\nHonor, wealth, family, ideals... such vocabulary flickers elusive, hovers, dissipates, and in the end there is left one, and only one...\n...\n...\n'Future...'\n'What? What did you see?'\n'...'\n'Hey, respond! Hey!'\nAll present lapse into silence. A young woman to the side wells with urgency.\n'Examine his brain! I told you we shouldn't have been so hasty! We only just set up protocol channels to database comms! This is only our first recorded successful transmission!'\n'...I'm sorry.'\n'Wait. What are you saying?'\n'I mean... I never used to be too fond of you planetary engineers. I always felt your work was all style, no substance... but I saw it. I saw your past, I shared in your past. I felt your emotions. It was... like nothing else.'\n'You...'\n'Yes. I felt you reminisce, like an ordinary father, about your children and your home. I saw that artificial moon, astonishing as anything. And the sensation, it's beyond all imagination... We've done it.'\nOnce again, everyone is silent.\n'So...' The one to break the silence is a fairly young, red-haired lady. 'How will it record our epoch, and the epochs to come?'\n'As an omnibus of idiocy, I assume,' someone responds thoughtlessly. 'We've had quite enough ourselves, but from here on out, none of them will ever find another excuse to embellish history.'\n'Have a little more faith in mankind, friends,' says another, elderly, who simply sits down and shuffles herself into a comfortable position. 'We've drawn enough lessons already. Our progeny won't be repeating our blunders.'\nSome chuckle bitterly. It is, of course, no more than a beautiful wish.\n'...So we've definitely succeeded? Project DWDB-221E has borne fruit so quickly... My god.'\nWith no warning, a curly-haired person springs to his feet.\n'Are we always going to call it DWDB-221E? I know, project numbering follows regulation format. Cold, cold nomenclature, just like with AMa... But our work <i>deserves</i> a more dignified official name!' Once again, he throws out the proposal he hadn't relented on for more than half the year now. 'I want to call it... 'Destiny'! Or maybe 'Truth of the World'?'\nThe ensuing silence is now an awkward one.\n'How about the 'Black Crown'? In terms of an intuitive visual impression of parts of its appearance, it does resemble a crown, after all.'\n'Eh, not a fan. That one sounds like some boring historical drama.'\n'In that case...'\nThe elderly woman interrupts her subordinates before they embroil themselves in yet another endless dispute. She gazes out at the stars beyond the window. Some unwelcome information is arriving, but humanity will ultimately overcome this hardship, just as it has countless times before.\n'I have a proposal...'\n'We should call it—'Civilight Eterna'.'",

          "description": "Sand circles above. In the rays of light, no longer can she trust anything before her.\nVoices call to her. Souls lift her hide-wrought bag, turn her dazedness to weariness.\nShe sees a land without limit, a land rich with life. She feels something tightly grip her hand. She looks back, and in the haze of memory fumbles for her own name.\nKal'tsit.\nShe knows she was born into these ruins of civilization bearing a calling, but there is no one to shine a light on what is to come for her. Ultimately, she cannot live free from this calling. It is akin to taking a meal, or sleeping.\nShe begins to walk, walk upon the lost dust, carefully sorting through her myriad years of memories and knowledge. She sees a new nation rise from yet more ruins. She recalls how the result of her abandonment was deposed royalty. She sees fresh, novel flags howl atop the blood-soaked battlefield. She recalls how both sides of the war united against a common enemy in those ancient times.\nShe sees forests yet thinks of barrens, gazes on mountains yet recollects lakes—she walks through the river that is Time, picking up stones, while the eras surge, parting around her, rushing forward on.\nBut she is immutable. She has no past, and no future either.\nIt takes her a deal of Time before she has her thoughts reorganized. She remembers the last death. The years stretching long enough to see the form of life itself change. Still, she never thought death would be so fast; some things are changing at this very moment.\nLives flourish without rhyme or reason, and the land morphs and fluctuates. Man-made machines operate with a rumble, the radiance of Originium energy shining into the umbra. In the dark, the people struggle, yearning for the light, scorning shadow in an age of brilliance, on and on. Her countenance is concealed by the flurry of grit stirred by a nomadic city, and she feels anxious to the depths of her heart.\nDoes the will that hid the stars behind the false sky still watch the surface recur in its rise and fall? How long until the Terrans, so proud of their thriving civilizations, personally send those same civilizations into the ice-cold void, to join countless lost lives?\nTime is running short. This is what Kal'tsit tells herself. She has fallen to blaming herself. She has wasted too much Time, and at so many moments barely averted the self-destruction of Terra, barely led them to a safe place to develop. It has exhausted her, drained her.\nShe is no omniscient, omnipotent being. And yet, she tasks herself with tending to the entire World.\nHer calling was never a fair one.\nShe has to hurry. She has to do whatever it takes.\nHer gaze comes to rest on a shattered Kazdel. It is far from the first time she's touched on the legend of the Lord of Fiends. In the boundless years, more than once she has thought of retrieving and exploiting this ancient force. She cannot help but stifle her memories of the Teekaz—to make an effort not to long for the bygone days where Originium had not yet molded life into its present form, and not to commemorate a possibility that has long since vanished.\nMaybe this time, it's time she made up her mind.\n......\n...\n'So this was your previous journey, Kal'tsit.'\n'It stretches longer than the fragment you've seen. Thousands and thousands of times longer, Theresa.'\n'But perhaps it's only now I've truly understood you... my enemy.'\n'...I feel the same, King of Sarkaz.'",

          "description": "The wind and sand kissed the sky, and by an oasis pool in the distance, a wandering merchant rested.\nKal'tsit stayed silent for a long time, standing on the deck. Occasionally, she looked out into the distance, and sometimes down at her feet. It was as if the ship called Rhodes Island was hiding something from her. Until a young vampire stepped forward, holding a stack of documents. Hesitating slightly, Closure interrupted Kal'tsit's thoughts.\n'Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals Inc.' Closure feigned a smile, swallowing her memories, and decided to continue, 'The work on this side of Rim Billiton is already done. Whew, those rabbits are a pain, none of them're as cute as Amiya. They wasted so much of our time, insisting the ship was registered for ore hauling...'\nClosure paused.\nFortunately, Kal'tsit snapped out of her reverie in time and gently responded in an almost soothing tone, 'Thank you for your hard work.'\n'What's next?'\n'Continuing the discussions we didn't finish in the last meeting.'\n'Are we going to lose more people?'\n'More people will leave.' Kal'tsit gazed into the distance where the wandering merchant had packed up, 'They belong to Babel, not Rhodes Island. I just hope there won't be any more bloodshed between us.'\n'I understand, but—'\nA voice interrupted the two.\n'Dr. Kal'tsit? Closure?'\nThe moment she heard the voice, a gentle and caring look flashed in Kal'tsit's eyes, but she quickly composed herself. 'Amiya, you should be resting.'\n'I'm fine. I just had another nightmare.' Amiya tugged at her collar, the wind was strong, and she was small, 'The trip to take the Doctor to Chernobog, and the days we spent in the wilderness... those Sarkaz warriors...'\nKal'tsit and Closure exchanged a quick glance. Closure understood what Kal'tsit meant; after all, both Ascalon and Ace visited Amiya often.\nThey didn't say anything; Amiya could sense it now as well.\n'Yes. They chose to be our enemies.'\n'Why?'\n'Because they live under the beautiful promise of Babel. They don't want to give up that illusion. And to them, we are deserters.'\n'Is Miss Theresa's promise an illusion?'\n'To them, yes.' Kal'tsit stood quietly beside Amiya and reached out to pat her head; she had grown a little taller. 'But they believe that continuing the war will solve all their problems.'\n'They're not entirely wrong, though.'\nKal'tsit was slightly surprised for a moment. She looked at Amiya, gazing at this tired and lost girl for a long time, until she finally felt a sense of relief. 'You're right, Amiya. They're not entirely wrong.'\n'What about the Doctor? Is Ursus safe?' Amiya looked up at Kal'tsit. 'I miss the Doctor a bit.'\nThis innocent gesture made Kal'tsit slightly flustered. At that moment, Closure embraced Amiya from behind.\n'Look, Amiya!'\nAmiya looked and saw an unfamiliar Rim Billitonian merchant, kicking up dust in the distance. The sand-covered cart tied with packages appeared heavy, and somehow cute.\nClosure playfully smiled and held Amiya even tighter.\n'Rhodes Island's journey is just beginning. When the Doctor returns, we'll be Terra's greatest Oripathy experts!'",

After three days, she waited no longer.\n13th of May, cloudy. She cut down a thirty-year-old tree in the courtyard with Tearrender, smashing the roof in. Wei Yenwu did not appear, and merely sent someone to plant a new tree. She never hoped for Wei Yenwu's acknowledgement again.\n1st of January, heavy rain. On a New Year's visit, in the downpour, she saw an injustice on her way to the slums, struck out in anger, and took fifteen on her own. In this moment of mortality, she fled into the night by her hilted sword, harming seven, repulsing eight. When she landed atop, Wei Yenwu made a rare appearance, saw the sword marks, and gave her a single look before leaving. She's forgotten why she struck out at the time, but will never forget the disappointment in that look.\n25th of December, clear. Acted in bravery while heading home from the Royal Guard Academy, totally fearless, slashing grand and bold, sparing as called for. She was high on spirit, believed she could hew away all injustice in the land.\n30th of July, cloudy. At the cost of five days unconscious, let out Shadowless, ultimately cutting down a major fugitive. Lungmen's Ch'en Hui-chieh, shining in prominence. After waking up, Chi Xiao was placed by her bedside, and Wei Yenwu hadn't once come to visit her.\n13th of August, overcast. Midway pursuing an Infected criminal, was eager to strike out with Chi Xiao. Chi Xiao did not budge one hair. Subsequently, in this moment of mortality, inspiration struck, Chi Xiao was unsheathed, and cut half a subterranean garage down. She sought Wei Yenwu to find out why Chi Xiao had and hadn't, but Wei Yenwu did not meet her.\n30th of September, clear. Chi Xiao was unsheathed a second time, cut open a treasury door, and saved the hostages within. She began to understand, Chi Xiao was a sword of will. She thought she had always done more than enough, but had in actuality done too little. She had to be faster, and mightier.\n7th of July, cloudy. On her birthday, over a decade coming, Wei Yenwu asked for the first time to see her swordplay. She condensed all she'd learned, and made an incomplete Cloudsplitter her final examination's answer. Wei Yenwu did not comment.\n1st of January, clear. Left Lungmen together with Rhodes Island. From here on forth, Chi Xiao will rarely be unsheathed.",

          "description": "The scars on the earth came blitzing in from the horizon, striking true at the Victorian-style complex. The buildings are like a forest torn apart by a whirlwind, collapsed in a radius surrounding a singular point. In these ruins of the Empire, two figures turn over a toppled stele, attempting to find higher ground.\n'How long has this place been empty?' Ch'en stands atop the rubble and looks into the distance. The names on the stele behind her once stood for glory, now all but worn away.\nBagpipe's voice comes from somewhere below. 'This school buildin's been abandoned since the war broke out. All the students who didn't complete their course yet got sent off to new campuses, finished the rest out there... Chenchen, that's our old trainin' grounds up in front. You remember?'\n'Especially well. I feel like my time as a student was defined by missing out on things. The moment I graduated, they finished repairing the roads, <i>and</i> the training grounds.'\nThe training grounds have been blown by the shockwave into a plate of jagged protrusions. Ch'en picks up a stone, flings it into a shrub sticking out of a crack in the plate, and a fowlbeast hiding within flies off for somewhere far away, screeching and cawing all the while.\n'Things were good enough as is, back then.' Bagpipe's voice comes in close as she stops and stands by Ch'en's ear.\n'True. It was probably the simplest time of my life. I didn't have all these issues weighing on my mind, I just had to focus purely on training and studying.'\n'That's what drove you? You trained like a maniac every day, got As on every standard subject and all.' Bagpipe clasps her hands on Ch'en's shoulders, and gently rocks back and forth.\n'After I returned, I realized just how many things couldn't be solved with swords. There were times I felt far too insignificant, and that even though I worked hard, I couldn't change all that much—sometimes, taking out the enemy doesn't do a thing to address the problem.' Ch'en shakes her head, as if trying to throw her tangled mess of feelings about the past straight out of her brain.\nThe two of them head up a steep slope. The flowerbed is still where they remember it.\nHalf of the logo of the once-eminent Royal Guard Academy is submerged in the mud, the other half resting against a fractured stone pillar. Sunset spills across, the light pouring over the symbol now mottled with rust, and what remaining metallic shine there is speaks to the place's former glory.\n'It's all changed. Victoria's changed too, hasn't it?' Ch'en mumbles to herself, staring at the crest.\n'Some people haven't changed. I went to go visit Instructor Tyrell a few days ago 'cause I knew you were comin'. You were gone in such a hurry back then, you just left all your papers and stuff in the dorms—she's been keepin' them safe all these years. All this is proof of you passin' your studies. Oh, aye, and this too!'\nBagpipe fishes out a stack of documents from her bag, as well as a wooden sword.\n'Here's the trainin' sword you used back then. Was meant to go back, technically speakin', but you did so smashin' the instructors were goin' to give you it, y'know, as a surprise for you...'\n'Give her my thanks. I left too quickly...'\n'At least you've come back now. So many of our year never have, even after all this time.'\nThe two fall silent.\n'Where do you think you'll be in ten years?'\n'Who knows? We should be heading back soon. There's still a lot to do.' Ch'en gazes into the distance, off in the direction of Lungmen. 'They arranged everything for me, whether it was going to this school or leaving it. Now, I'm going to go back by myself.'",

It's just complicated enough for you, right? Just listening to that huge string of numbers makes my head want to explode.'\n'No. It's because of a predecessor of mine.'\n'Care to explain?'\n'The year I'd just assumed Deputy Minister duties at the Central Judicial Office, I'd been rummaging through files in light of a case I had, only to find that in order to fell a great villain, he'd employed counterfeit evidence at their impeachment. Despite him already being retired at the time, I convinced the Censor to recall him to the capital for punishment.'\n'Uh, I'm not going to weigh in on whether that was right for you to do or not. Can I ask what this has to do with me?'\n'I only later came to know that said predecessor had not retired under normal circumstances, and was frankly not in his hometown caring for his family as one would assume... He'd concealed his identity and been appointed to chase down a series of unsolved cases... At the time, he'd practically figured out the third child's whereabouts, and it was exactly then when I just so happened to learn of his early mistake—what are you doing? Stop rubbing my shoulder...'\n'You were used. Which also means, if it wasn't for this case, my dad's whole deal would've come to light forever ago, huh?! No need to pull that face, I'm not blaming you for this. All I can say is that this is a real complicated affair... Don't let me interrupt you, go on.'\n'At the time, your father had suddenly been given a transfer. He departed for Victoria; in the two weeks following my predecessor being taken into custody, the Central Judicial Office scrollery suffered an inexplicable fire one night, and all the south's documents were reduced to ash... The Tianshi are correct. As a Central Judicial Office Deputy Minister, I must investigate the truth of this matter, and to do so, I must renounce my very Central Judicial Office Deputy Minister status... hence why I must take it on now.'\n'You can't give me that again! Tell me everything you know, now. All of it. Chop-chop.'\n'No. You can't help me. These days, you are no more than 'a Victorian lodging aboard Rhodes Island.' You need only tell me what <i>you</i> know, all the things you've been through, and you can leave the rest to me.'\n'And I call that crap! The guy who died the land's most inexplicable death in a whole other country was my dad, not yours, and the woman who's dead according to her official paperwork and had to spend so long without a life except one on the move is me, not you. You may as well have never taken your mask off here, if it wasn't gonna make you any better at talking to me! Jeez, I know what you're worrying about, but there's nothing to fear! I'm an Elite Operator of Rhodes Island! Have you seen me with my chainsaw or not? Have you experienced my heat or not? I don't CARE how complicated the case is or how many enemies we've got, you think they get to burrow away in the shadows their entire lives?'\n'......'\n'...Oh, yeah, did you mention just now your predecessor chased down that third kid's whereabouts?'",

As bubbles and white smoke erupt uncontrollably out of the water, in unison with an intense searing sound, she finds herself unable to take her eyes away.\nThe cooled dagger sits atop a smithing table, and Lava herself personally etched a crude depiction of her own horns on it.\n\n'That's so sick! Miss, I want one too!'\nThe children of the slums rarely get to eat anything tasty, and they have certainly never seen the sweet treats that Lava is so fond of.\nEver since Lava removed the small, sweet-smelling pouch dangling from her waist and carefully divvied the snow-white, delicious treats evenly among all the timidly outstretched hands, the children here forgot all about the stories their parents had told them about 'Devils'. They even began looking forward to this super cool lady coming to play with them.\nWhen she sees that the animosity in the children's black eyes has faded bit by bit, from both time and her displays of goodwill, Lava finally asks a question that she's wanted to ask for a very long while.\n'Do you guys know what Arts are?'\nLava starts to manifest red, burning flowers one after another, their branches glowing beautifully under the night sky.\nThe children want to approach, but are too scared to. Lava then takes their hands and crouches down to teach them the basics of Arts.\nLava has never seen them imitate her so excitedly, and, surprisingly, she finds a few of them managing to eke out a few sparks. Their Arts may be crude and imperfect, but they certainly lit up their elated faces.\nLava decides to do something that she's always wanted to do.\nEven just for material reasons, it's a good idea to learn Arts. It helps you find a stable job and fills your stomach. You won't have to starve in the cold slums anymore. It's how you escape the fate that's haunted you your whole life.\n\nAs time goes by, one day after another, the world hasn't gotten any better. Nor has it gotten any worse. It yet fosters both misfortune and joy, as well as life and death.\nThe children here have learned the Sarkaz's Arts. They haven't become any better or worse, and they continue to live here, peacefully as ever. But their future has already started to change.\nBy passing this newly forged dagger around from one tiny, curious hand to the next, Lava is slowly changing things her own way.",

          "description": "Looking at the boy in front of her, Ch'en is somewhat taken aback.\n'Your mother? Smuggling?'\n'Yes. But she was forced into it by my dad.'\n'And you want me to save her?'\n'My dad and his associates will be waiting for her in the square.'\n'How do you know that?'\n'...I used to be the one helping him with this.' The boy gritted his teeth. 'My dad once promised that after making enough money, he'd take my mom and me on a cruise, and we could see a rainbow over the sea from there. But he never kept his word. He just kept chasing dirty money, forcing me to work with him, and now he wants to drag my mom down with him too. I can't stand it anymore.'\nCh'en notices bruises on the boy's neck. With her years of experience, she instantly knew he was telling the truth.\n'...Don't worry. If what you say is true, I'll make sure your father and his crew get the punishment they deserve.'\nAt the word 'punishment,' the boy, who had kept his head down, suddenly looks up. 'Does prison really change people?'\n'...Why do you ask?'\n'My dad wasn't like this before. Ever since we came to Dossoles, he's been obsessed with making money. I don't even know when he changed... maybe he's always been this way. But I can't forget the look in his eyes when he first told me he'd take me on a cruise to see a rainbow.'\nLooking at the boy, Ch'en is reminded of her past self. Back then, she had always wanted a certain someone to notice her sword. But at some point, she stopped hoping for that.\n'This city is surrounded by water. Rainbows should be easy to find here. Haven't you seen enough of them?'\n'...No. I have to see a rainbow with him, on a cruise; nothing else counts.'\nYes, it only counts if he's there.\n'Hah. And you still want that, even now?'\n'Yeah.' There is a faint glimmer of hope in the boy's eyes, but it quickly fades. 'But I can't do it alone.'\nCh'en is silent for a moment, then grabs her water gun and walks in the direction the boy had indicated. Before going, she leaves him with a final piece of advice.\n'Then you'll have to find a way to make your father listen to you. Make him understand that you want him to change... At the very least, let him know what you're thinking.'\nThat day, there was a sudden downpour in Dossoles. In the rain, Ch'en saved a woman from a group of criminals and subdued the culprits.\nStrangely, just as the gang leader was about to fight back, a child suddenly stepped between him and Ch'en. The rain had stopped at some point, and a rainbow arched across the sky. Beneath it, the gang leader hesitated, and the child seemed to say something to him. Finally, the leader lowered his weapon.\nWitnesses nearby reported that, although Ch'en had successfully resolved another smuggling case, she didn't seem happy. She simply looked off to the east, lost in thought.",

          "description": "Margaret, clad in a full suit of armor, clutches a wooden swordstaff in hand, focusing her attention on confronting the man in front of her. \nThe wooden sword swaying gently in his hands reveals no hostility at all, but Margaret knows that if she lets her guard down even for a second, that sword would bypass her swordstaff and lightly tap her on the head. \nUsing the range advantage of her swordstaff, Margaret repeatedly probes her opponent. As usual, her opponent momentarily leaves an opening for her, and she seizes the opportunity and thrusts forward with her swordstaff.\n'Well done, Margaret.' Schnitz Nearl falls to the ground, pretending to be helpless, lying there as he smiles and shows his daughter a thumbs-up. \n'Father...'\nSince she began her combat training, Margaret has rarely landed a blow on the man.\nBut this time...\n'Did, did I do it right?'\n'You did. You did a great job, Margaret.'\n'Do you think you can help me up now?'\n'S-Sure. I'm sorry, Father.' Margaret hurriedly sets down her swordstaff and grabs her father's hand with both of hers, using all her strength to pull him off the ground. \n'A good showing, young foal. Now even your father is no match for you.'\nMargaret's mother, Yolanta, appears at the training area's entrance carrying Maria, who is still a baby, in a swaddle blanket.\n'Haha, you should've seen how much momentum she had behind that last thrust.'\n\n'Mother, what brings you here?' \nIt is late at night, but Margaret sees that her mother is neatly-dressed and carrying a suitcase, as if getting ready to go out.\n'It's almost time, Schnitz. Put yourself together.'\n'Alright, give me five minutes.'\nThe father takes off his training pads, revealing the suit of armor underneath.\n'Mother, Father, where are you going?'\n'I'm sorry, my child, but we can't tell you.'\n'Just imagine we're heading up north to buy you some souvenirs.'\n'A-Are you going to be gone for a long time?'\n'Yes...' Margaret's father is deep in thought for a moment. 'It might take a bit of time.'\n'So, can we ask you for a little favor, Margaret?'\n'I'm listening, Mother. I promise I'll do whatever I can!'\n'First of all...' the mother squats down and hands the sleeping Maria to the young girl. 'I'll need you to take care of your little sister and your grandpa.'\nThough Maria was not heavy at the time, when Margaret held her, she gripped her carefully for fear that her sister would fall from her arms.\n'If you have any questions about combat techniques, you can ask your uncle. He has much more experience than your father does.'\n'Yes, Father...'\n......\n'Is there anything else you want to say?'\n'That's about it.'\nKnock, knock, knock––\nSomeone is at the door.\nShe feels each knock pounding at her heart, striking her with fear.\nHer parents are about to leave.\nHer father readies his swordstaff, and her mother readies her bow. Margaret follows them to the door.\nWhen it opens, two campaign knights in silver armor stand before them.\nTo Margaret, they look like a pair of man-eating monsters.\n'Lord Schnitz, Lady Yolanta, we have instructions to escort you out of the Grand Knight Territory.\nThe parents agree in hushed voices, then turn back to Margaret.\nSchnitz hugs Margaret and Maria tightly.\nYolanta leaves a heavy kiss on their cheeks.\nMargaret stands in the doorway, watching her parents' figures grow fainter and fainter.\nThe whole time, she expected her parents to suddenly turn back to tell her it was all a prank.\nShe expected her uncle, who had watched her parents depart from outside the door, would go bring them back to the warmth of their family. \nShe even expected her sickly grandfather upstairs to rush down and drive away the troublemaking campaign knights.\nBut her expectations were dashed.\nHer pride and her sunlight slowly disappeared to the edge of the Grand Knight Territory, never to be seen again.\nMargaret feels an emptiness inside.\nAll she can do is close the door behind her and hug her sister tightly.\nNothing more.",

          "description": "We find ourselves in the shadows, as it always has been.\nIt is midnight, and naught in the tavern but a dim light shines on The Radiant Knight's face. I recall when first we met... it was rare to see someone so composed, so at peace. That, Liz and I knew better than anybody. Here, her sister sleeps over her knees, muttering a word or two from time to time, but The Radiant Knight holds still, unstirring. Estranged for so many years, she elects, quietly, simply, to watch over her family. Whislash—Zofia—does not disturb the two. In fact, she combs Nearl's hair and tail for her. The Radiant Knight's locks are matted with blood, blood of the shadows. Shadows whose echoes are stayed outside of this bar, peaceful as it is, for a time.\nLiz is somewhat drowsy, but adamant not to rest. We have much to say to The Radiant Knight, to Operator Nearl of Rhodes Island, to Margaret. Fortunate or misfortunate it may be, but I am familiar with her entirety, her every part. Hence, I knew long ago this day would come. Hence, I've harbored since long ago this quiet hint of unease. Reluctance.\nI know we won't truly be parting. Yet we each have our own matters to face, and indeed, these matters are leagues unalike.\nMaria wakes, comes to find she's been sleeping on her sister, and flushes somewhat. Zofia makes sharp barbs, scolds the two on their less than model appearances. She is dwarfed by Nearl by some centimeters, and without realizing, always cranes her head to speak to her; the posture seems a strain. It <i>is</i> rude of me, but I cannot help scrutinizing Whislash's expression as she stands before The Radiant Knight. Is there defiance in what she feels? Does she long to fight alongside her, shoulder to shoulder? Does she place her ideals and convictions into this knight of flesh and bone?\nAnd how is it that <i>I</i> see Margaret? As... a companion of the Followers? We break bread together, suffer together, no part of us reserved. We...\nMargaret claps my shoulder. She tells me she's been wanting to borrow my ear herself. She's back home, back to Kazimierz, where she began. But <i>we</i> began elsewhere: in Kazdel, in Sargon, in Londinium... Our guilt, our tribulations, do not lie here. It has me curious then, very much so, about what those led to set forth by her light see when they lift their heads, and look to the dark night.\nA pang of regret strikes me. It makes sense; I've always detested my lineage, its supposed beauty something I've never tasted. Such love, such meaning in family, by all rights belong to her, and are to be celebrated and kept in sight. While by all the same rights, I do not belong here, and should find my own path. In coming here, her radiance will certainly be gone for a time from the tower that is her corporeal self, to see to the countless promises we made in the barrens, in the battlefield, in Rhodes Island.\nYes... Hence, I've given up on saying what need not be said. I smile silently back at her, and that is all.\nThe original sin of a Confessarius is not in a place of pure darkness. Light has been foretold.\nWe find ourselves in the shadows. This, in spite of each of our shadows' oracles being our own, each a different soothsayer.\nMargaret pushes the tavern door open, saying what comes to mind. —A knight should examine herself, survey herself, to discipline as disciplined. We must become our own light. Once we are set aflame, all will find that the shadows never bound them—\n\n—As it always has been.",

She mentioned something about the future of the Volcano Museum of Siesta and her plans for retirement, which would very likely be delayed. I knew that she wanted me to visit Siesta as much as possible in the future—not just for research.\n\n[Recording: Singing with music]\nTitle: Singing at a Cake Shop\nDescription:\nIt's been a while since I last came back, and I had this feeling that this little town was stuck in time and nothing was ever going to change.\nHowever, I accidentally noticed that the cake shop Mom used to like so much had finished its renovation and reopened. A lot of musicians even came to the courtyard, holding impromptu performances.\nI heard a very familiar melody that day and went up close, and the singer invited me to join them! *Sighs* It was a pity I couldn't remember the lyrics and wasn't quite sure which part everyone was singing, so I just struggled to hum along... Hope I wasn't off-key too much.\n\n[Recording: An academic talk]\nTitle: On-campus Seminar\nDescription:\nI brought the data from Mount Siesta back to William University and met with Dr. Kahn and other scholars there. Dr. Kahn seemed a little unsettled. I told him it was not a big deal, but by the looks of it, that wasn't much help.\nThankfully, after some small talk, we started discussing research on volcanoes, and Dr. Kahn finally found peace and became more relaxed.\nThe seminar was exciting. No one seemed to care that we were not in a classroom, laboratory, or meeting room, but just standing on a path on campus.\nIt felt really nice.\n\n[Recording: Ripped audio from a childhood video]\nTitle: I Still Remember That Wish\nDescription:\nI left the university and came back home.\nI changed the curtains, threw away some old stuff I didn't need anymore, and found a childhood video in the process. It was a shame that most of the content was damaged. Fortunately, the soundtracks were intact, so I got to rip them and re-record them onto this tape.\nI heard Mom and Dad singing me the birthday song and encouraging me to make a wish. Of course, I didn't say it out loud, but I still remember it—\nNow I'm on my way to making it come true.\n\n[Recording: Friends' laughing]\nTitle: A Welcome Party For Me!\nDescription:\nI returned aboard for my regular check-up after settling everything at home. It'd been a long time since I last left Rhodes Island, and guess what? People held a welcome party for me!\nProvence and Angelina caused a little chaos when they set off the firework tubes and accidentally knocked down a huge pile of dolls. Then next thing I remember was little lambs coming from nowhere and rampaging all about... It was a disaster. But everyone was laughing so hard.\nI really hope these kinds of moments can last longer.\n\n[Recording: N/A]\nTitle: Untitled\nDescription:\nFor the next field investigation.\nI'd love to keep more recordings if I have the chance—the sound of lava, wind, rain, and the people around me.",

Her name's Texas, you said? I've never heard it. I keep to myself, you know.'\n'What happened? Everything was normal, I was there at the counter spacing out. A little shop like ours doesn't do much business at three in the afternoon. Students are still in school, and the office types come by at noon to stretch their limbs for a bit before their bosses pull them back to work. I suppose officers like you on patrol mind our business now and again. Do you know Madame Oni? The tall, tall Inspector with a horn on her head? She and I—'\n'Black suits! Er, I was a little nervous, there must've been twenty in all. Us ordinary folks never see things like that. They were all rushing Miss Texas and that briefcase, and whatever they had in their hands, they were shiny and glinting! You see something like that for real, I dare say, and it makes those movies look like child's play! You know, Ah Sir, I'm a professional, I've seen every kung fu movie to ever come out in Lungmen, but the way Miss Texas squared up was completely different. She doesn't even seem that old. I don't dare imagine where she learned those insane moves, or how she got so trained.'\n'Right, the camera has me hiding under the counter, but I heard it all crystal clear! A dagger got sent flying and landed right next to me! Then a red-haired Sankta came in, I think probably to help Miss Texas, because I heard them say hi. She was called Exusiai? And then there was this whole massive rumble, that was something wild! I could feel my own liver shaking!'\n'Then it all died down, and I found the guts to come out from under the counter, and the black suits were all on the ground, and my shop was—ah, you don't have to worry about that, there were two big stars who came by later on. Miss Sora was one, and then the other was that rapping Liberi. They compensated me wonderfully, enough I could fix up my shop and open a cystybeast meatball stall.'\n'What about Texas? Er, she... she picked out some snacks after it went down and went to me to pay. It was the kind that's really popular with schoolkids, the biscuit sticks with the coating. She bought a whole handful of boxes. Chocolate, vanilla and the new salted one, and she bought a woven bag for a dollar too.'\n'What do you mean, I'm not telling you anything useful? You listen to me, that bag is designed by our shop! It's got cartoons on it!'\n'Alright, enough from me. Still, Ah Sir, there's one more thing—do you L.G.D. people know this Miss Texas? Tell her for me: the reward from her stamp card came in, a limited edition baseball cap, so if she can drop in when she's got the time...'\nNote by personnel on shift: Filed under Folder-Penguin Logistics 1097 (102), all charges on incident provisionally dropped.",

          "description": "Feeling in the dark, Reed untangles her hair with utmost care, then stands herself straight once more.\nA dream comes to mind, one she always used to have. Her sister stands behind her in her shadow, watching as she puts on a deathly heavy crown. She feels it's wrong for her to be wearing it, but she can't take it off no matter how she tries; all she can do is melt it by fire. Metal trickles down her face, scalding, searing, but the idea of the purple flame bringing her comfort, ice-cold, scares her more. So she makes not a sound.\nAnd she recalls two people she met while pursuing the high-speed battleships' tracks a few days ago, ordinary folk. They knew the name of Dublinn—their land showed scars from being razed by fire. They asked Reed point-blank, are you the one who ruined our lives? The Draco, manipulator of the flame of life, fell silent for a while. She was familiar with the fear her sister could leave in people. But in the end, she nodded, for she is the Leader of Dublinn, and the Tarans have no need for two Dublinns.\nSomeone is calling her name. She leaves, through the tight wooden door.\n—She crosses a threshing floor, filled with hay and cardboard stage props of every color.\nHer costume's a little cumbersome—everyone wanted to drape their own two sashes over her, in much the manner one nestles two flowers for their beloved in a buttonhole. Surely the Red Dragon didn't take to the battlefield like this a millennium ago.\nBut no matter. They don't have to trouble themselves with the looks of the crown-bearer. Let the wandering minstrels suppose, for the sake of a rhyme, that the Draco hero of legend had hair just as flowing and golden.\nReed clears her throat and swishes her tail, a little wary. The Tarans in front of her don't know how each brook of muddy waters tracing through the marsh is the track of a galloping warship. They don't know that the bleak clouds to the north that never blow this way are the fumes of war. They don't know that what Reed grasps is the very flame of the Red Dragon of Tara. They simply know it's important to still have food to eat after their taxes are levied, and it's as important to make sacrifice and perform theater so their farmwork is bountiful and blessed. Sat in the back are the soldiers who've fought all the way alongside her, and they look at her just as expectantly. They've taught Reed that a failure to learn the lines means no good harvest in the coming year.\n'I give you land, and I give you the weather to nurture it.'\nA fire ignites at her speartip in time with her words, and the audience abruptly settles down. At this moment, all could swear they have some vague premonition as to who it is that stands before them.\nReed lowers her head. A child places a floral garland on her head of every color under the sun, each flower a symbol of a growing, flourishing crop.\nIt is light, almost weightless. She bows down, and to the village's script, unchanged in all its years, she adds one line.\n'I give you peace.'",

          "description": "I got lectured by the instructors at the Training Room. Kroos kept staring at me the whole time after I messed up, and she called for me come with her after we wrapped up. I thought she was going to chew me out too, but instead she gave me some cake.\nShe must've seen how down I was feeling. But I did mess up, that's a fact. I saw a teammate ahead to my left who hadn't noticed the danger behind him, so I went to go help him. I acted without warning, and didn't expect to get hit by a training bolt. I caused the mission to fail right then and there. The instructors said no one should be making such a basic mistake. I was so embarrassed.\n'Shh. This is from my secret stash~'\nI nodded and gave a bite. It was sweet and creamy, with roasted apple slices on top, and—wrapped chocolates inside?!\n'I was gonna put something in there that'd break your teeth right off, but seeing how you were on the verge of tears, I switched it for chocolate, see?'\nKroos unwrapped one and popped it into her mouth, then unwrapped another for me. We sat on the bench next to the door to the Training Room, and she told me all sorts of things. How she'd made her own mistakes—ones just like mine today—how she'd gotten into massive arguments with her teammates over a disagreement in the field, how she had all these pranks of hers, and how she'd remodeled her crossbow.\nAnd at the very end, I'd finished the cake, and put the chocolate in my bag. Kroos patted me on the head and said, 'You're going to remember today's lesson, aren't you?'\n'I just thought, if I'd seen it but didn't help, I'd regret it...'\nShe gave me a serious look. 'If something does happen for real, regret'll just be part and parcel. Training helps us not make the same mistakes in real combat.' She tossed a toy at me, some kind of prank thing again. 'Use this to give that other operator of yours a fright!'\n'But don't tell anyone I've been stashing the sweet stuff again!'\nA long while later, I'd finally become a formal operator, and I made the correct decision in a crisis. Nobody was even hurt. In a rush of glee, I couldn't help but think of that day, of Kroos's cake and the things she told me.\nI sought her out after I returned to the landship, and once she'd finished taking in my combat report, she showed me something. It was a thick, dense file, with line after line of planned adjustments for the training equipment's trigger timing, and how every Reserve Operator would respond. All in her handwriting.\n'Less regrets this way,' she laughed. 'You did great.'",

The only thing she needs to do is let herself relax, place herself into the best possible state to be thrown into the next mission, the next battle.\nThe record is a masterpiece of the Iberian Golden Age, bought by her off an Iberian operator's hands.\nSpecter closes her eyes, lets herself sink into the sofa, and enjoys it in stillness.\nShe couldn't tell you a thing about what accomplishments marked Iberia's Golden Age, but she can sense from the music the splendor of that age, and how its people must have been so proud of their successes.\nIt's not godawful at all, she concedes.\nShe never masks her disdain for the glories of dry land's culture, but she has no intents of applying that prejudice to the arts—\nYes. Prejudice.\nShe even admits as much to the Doctor, while continuing on her merry way.\nBut her insistence isn't without meaning.\nBesides, she believes that while her and the Captain seem to have it in common, there's actually quite the distinction.\nThe Captain's arrogance comes from that good old Captain purview of Chief Designer. But she—she thinks—she doesn't care where her power comes from, and she's passionate about what undertakings she has these days. But still, sometimes she can't help but wonder—how has that statue in her hometown ended up? How about her hometown itself?\nThe music comes to a crackling halt.\nLaurentina opens her eyes, and what gradually seeps into view is her familiar ceiling. She knows, terrifyingly, she'll get even more used to this environment in time. She's not panicked about it. In order to panic in a new environment, you need to not want to leave the old one, but she's practically forgotten just how her life in Ægir felt to live.\nFrom the record box she now pulls a sawblade, and gently wipes over it, swapping for a new record to continue playing all the while. Maybe, just as the Iberians used all the methods under the sun to record their Golden Age, she can try and get back into her once most beloved activity—sculpting.\nHer one stroke of luck: she might just be stuck away from home for a good while longer. She still has enough time to remember how it looked, she thinks, with no lack of self-mocking irony.",

          "description": "'It is as if slaughtering those overgrown cuts of meat has become our unignorable, even our one-and-only, calling.'\nThe clock ticks and tocks. The dreadnought obstructs the rays as they come down from the dome. Ulpianus lifts his head and fixes his eyes on the flickering indicator lights, as if in thought.\n'It ought not be,' the young female Consul replies, following a long hesitation.\n'Of course it ought not. When an Ægir wakes, the first thought that enters their mind should not be of what they've lost, never. Nor of how to take back what they've lost.' Ulpianus is silent for a juncture, some kind of emotion flowing about his raspy throat. After a good while, he sighs, 'Oh, how many magnificent works we once made.'\n'And now, the battle to survive has become the only to-do list that this new generation knows.'\n'Battle. A glorious word, to be sure. And yet, our outstanding creativity and pursuit of beauty have been all but forgotten.'\nThe two simultaneously gaze afar. Lights dazzle beneath the dome.\n'...Not by choice.' Ulpianus adds.\nGladiia shoots a glance at Ulpianus, mulls over the wording for a moment, then speaks inquisitively: 'You were never the type to be so receptive to sentimentality.'\n'Indeed.' Ulpianus does not halt this time. 'We should address this matter solemnly. Our culture is in the midst of being permanently altered by these protracted days of calamity.'\nA colossal rumbling cuts short Gladiia's pregnant pause. More ships are entering port, a new fleet of migration and reconstruction, and she is left to ponder in earnest what Ulpianus has said. Over the pursuit of beauty, over the creation of the new. Before she was born, or perhaps earlier than that... centuries ago? Millennia? When the Ægir founded this stark and grand culture—did they imagine that now, its radiance would be so dull?\nDid they make any preparations for the present day?\nGladiia's thoughts are lost for but an instant. To her, the past is of unimportance. More vital are what preparations she is soon to make, what things she <i>can</i> do.\n'A new Abyssal Hunter.' Ulpianus unceremoniously breaks the silence. 'I hear she previously had quite an interest in the arts. Ballet, opera, she's dabbled in it all.'\n'Laurentina has mentioned a rather profound recollection of the sculpture in her hometown.'\n'Then she still retains some of the essence what all Ægir should have by rights.' Ulpianus turns around. The Consul's light attire for the season cannot conceal his body scarred by experimentation. 'What is she like? If she truly is an epitome of Ægir life from days gone by, then being forced away from the proper course of things must fill her with so much hate.'\n'No. Such sentimentality is but a small supplement to her whole.'\nGladiia breaks into a rare smile. This, despite how her smiles always took careful observation and judgment, on the muscular and nervous levels.\n'She creates a beauty of her own through battle. One of the sorts you speak of, with great exuberance.'\nUlpianus makes a light and noncommittal harrumph in response, after which he soon leaves Gladiia by herself under those gigantic shadows to appreciate the serenity.\nThe grand hall echoes with only the sounds of the Ægir's footsteps forward.",

A young woman's goods trolley stops by in Medical, where she unhitches a delivery and transfers it piecemeal over to the department's postal desk.\n'No, thank <i>you,</i> really. We're not meant to leave non-staff with odd jobs like this, especially not when you've just recovered from your injuries, and you're still an active Oripathy patient on top.' Hibiscus hands her a small origami floret, then takes in each parcel one by one—this one is bed 6; this letter goes to the old man in bed 13; this giant but feather-light box is for the girl in ICU 5, and inside is probably the doll they mentioned buying her last time...\n'Don't be like that! I can move around on my own two feet now—do you really want me lazing about in bed?' The woman secures her travel jacket, fastidiously fastening the topmost two buttons and nestling the paper flower in her collar. 'I'm a Messenger by trade. All this time aboard waiting to heal has been killing me—you know, Dr. Hibiscus, didn't you say getting up and about would spur my recovery?'\n'You still have to pay attention to your condition, though,' Hibiscus says, shaking the monitoring bracelet on her wrist.\nThe young woman gets the message, and taps at her own monitor, worn in the same place.\n'Will you still be working as a Messenger after your discharge?'\n'Yep. It's what I've been. Heading everywhere and back again, that's my life. A few bumps and scrapes can't do more than put that on hold.'\n'Oripathy's more than a bump and a scrape, you know. Keep your report in mind.'\n'The sun always glows its last, day after day. Life just carries on.'\n......\n'Dr. Hibiscus, I'm going to sign out and discharge after I'm done with this shipment. Do you have anything you want mailed? Now that I'm returning to work, it'd be my honor to have you as my first customer, believe me.'\n'Where's your next stop?'\n'I'm heading back to Vyseheim first—that's where I grew up. You were in the Afterglow organizing treatment for Oripathy patients back then, right?'\nHibiscus plucks her own corsage from her chest—one of Originium, long-inert. The lifeless crystal that composes it is silent and still, now no different from ash, withered branches, dried tears. There was someone who carved this with all their heart into a hibiscus, gleaming with a black luster.\n'Then could you take this flower back with you, if that's alright? Give it back to Vyseheim for me, please.'\nI hope that Vyseheim, and you, can truly make a full recovery.",

A few shadows gently sway.\n'Come in.'\nThe hut door is hefted open, and a mass of somewhat hasty green squeezes into the firelit space, having to get far more intimate with the doorframe than doorframes typically experience.\n'Got everything?'\n'Y—You bet...' Gavial gives her head an impromptu massage.\n'Bring it out.'\nGavial hoists her tail back to bundle up the bag behind her, and takes great care to open it up on the table. Out fall a wide assortment of weapons. Those standing around the table grab one each.\n'Dagger.'\n'Cutting edge is sharp. Signs of whetstoning.'\nAnother voice makes itself known. Gavial twists her head around looking for it, only to quickly give up and pull it back.\n'Chainsaw.'\n'No junk in the chain, lubrication on drive shaft is fresh, and handle wraps have been changed before. Motor system is running well, power system is stable.'\n'Uh-huh. The axe?'\n'About the same condition as the chainsaw. The only difference is the axe has some slight rusting...'\n'Don't mind her. The metal was rusted when I made it.' Yet another voice has emerged.\n'...Didn't you tell me you used the best materials?'\n'Those <i>are</i> the best materials. Even the 'Rage Ironhide' didn't get it as good as this.'\n'Quit it a sec, you two, we're not done yet... Gavial.'\n'Here...'\n'Where's your staff?'\n'Muhh, my staff...' Gavial hangs her head low.\n'Where is your staff? Bring it out.'\nGavial realizes she's not winning this, grinds her teeth, and pulls her staff out of her boot. Well, boots.\n'Staff's... broken.'\n'How did you break it?'\n'Clobbering people out there over the last few days. I just gave it a whack once and... it snapped.'\n'How? You know I reinforced it. All you had to do was take good care of it and... Gavial, give me the inspection form. Have you filled it in properly?'\n'No duh I did!'\n'What were you doing last month on the 3rd? You were meant to give it maintenance that day, but you've written nothing here. Did you forget?'\n'Did not. I was, uh, I was busy that day with... oh! No, I got it! I was scrapping with the Durins' machines! You even gave them the blueprints for those!'\n'I do recall that, but it doesn't change the fact you wrecked your staff, so...'\nGavial sucks in a deep, deep breath. 'So like you laid out. Five days without eating meat. I'm ready for it...'\nAfter a brief silence, with the table shooting a few glances between each other, there's the sudden telltale 'pfft' of a laugh.\n'What the hell's so funny... Tomimi? Zumama? Inam! What are you guys laughing for?' Gavial asks through a frown of complete suspicion.\nInam is scratching at her head. 'Gavial, the fact that you can take proper care of your weapons is <i>impressive.</i> I wonder if we can thank the statue being erected...'\n'I literally guaranteed you guys! You didn't even believe me?!'\n'We're only finding out in the first place because people tell us you keep complaining about weapon upkeep being a hassle,' Zumama explains.\n'We wouldn't let you go without meat for five days, Gavial... that would be too scary for you,' Tomimi quietly adds.\nGavial sighs a slow sigh of relief. 'Scared the hell outta me. I seriously thought you guys were gonna have me lashed down...'\n'I'll make you another staff. Remember to care for it regularly!'\n'Yeah, you don't have to tell me... huh? Something smells good. Is that—'\n'That said, seeing how we know you, we decided we'd punish you via other means... This is a whole pot of Acahualla-sourced meat stew!' Inam unveils. 'Gavial, you have to stand over there and watch us while we eat the entire thing.'\nGavial's eyes pop out of her skull. 'You guys are torturers! ACTUAL TORTURERS!'",

Such caution reminded him of growing up in his shanty, where his mother would use salvaged materials to work a bit of Arts, igniting a small spark of light in their dark home after the sun had set, allowing him to read for a while in its glow. Then the fuel burned out, erupting in pungent smoke and dazzling sparks, spurring a moment of tremendous brightness before plunging them into darkness again.\nHe was now quite familiar with this pitch-black wilderness, devoid of light and any other people besides himself. Dim fireflies couldn't illuminate even a couple of steps ahead, leaving only the whooshing of the wind, and sometimes not even that.\nGreyy set up his framework, input data, racked the equipment on the frame, and started it running. He wasn't entirely sure what this thing could bring about, just a string of data he had calculated a few days ago; he was doing his best to bring it to life, hoping for some results. Maybe it could provide stable power to a village, perhaps it could fill in a missing piece of a technical puzzle, or maybe it would amount to nothing more than a dazzling but useless spark.\nHe was no longer afraid of the darkness, but he still grew tense, fearing that he might not even produce a spark this time.\n'Don't be scared, boy. I work at the poor house, I've seen too many dying people surrounded by loved ones. In times like those, all emotions mean something, just don't be afraid, fear doesn't help.'\nThe device flickered to life, disturbing the fireflies, causing them to flutter and fly farther into the wilderness, where they were quickly swallowed by the darkness.\nThe light illuminated the night, but it quickly dissipated within the dark, not even managing to burst into a spark.\n'Another failure...'\nGreyy slumped to the ground in despair. The wind blew across the wilderness. He didn't feel cold, only the sensation of his mother embracing him.\nHe closed his eyes, and in the far distance, the generator in the village suddenly spun into action, the entire settlement flickering to life. Yet in this quiet night, no one saw it, including Greyy, who had finally fallen into a deep sleep.\nInside, Mechanist's light suddenly intensified. He looked out the window, and a star in the sky blinked at him, a brilliant white light shining on the wastelands, as if an eternal star had finally touched the ground.\nMechanist closed the book he had been reading and walked out.\n'You can be scared, boy, but don't stop!'",

          "description": "Nothing could be more stupid than having to name your own weapon, Texas thinks, staring at the form in front of her.\nNuova Volsinii forbids the carrying of weapons, even hidden ones, but Penguin Logistics is without a doubt a special case. Hence, their need to file a little additional registration. It doesn't mean they can use weapons in urban areas, but simply that under certain circumstances, their weapons will be returned to them.\nWhich is not to say she has to go through something as dumb as weapon NAMING, of course, it's just—she sees Exusiai elatedly wracking the ol' noggin and filling in names she came up with a second ago for each one of her guns, and she catches the gaze Exusiai throws her way from time to time— appreciation mixed with eagerness—and she knows that if she doesn't do it herself, Exusiai will snatch away her paperwork and give her two new swords names so stupid you'd call them groundbreaking.\nShe really can't say she's all that invested in these blades, given that she only reluctantly accepted them as a gift in the first place. Frankly, she's not even the type to get hung up on this stuff—if the swords she'd been using before weren't of fairly unique make, she'd probably have changed weapons several times over by now.\nMoreover, the maker of these twin swords was doubtlessly trying to draw some sort of... spiritual thing from the story of the Texas family name, which was then affixed squarely on top. And despite the fact that it made even more headache for her, it led even the official inspecting her weapons to cast her an expectant look, as if to say 'surely, arms such as these must have wonderful names.'\nThe door opens with a groan, and in come Sora and Croissant toting bags of all sizes. Their new base is in dire need of dressing up, and the two of them have always been on decor duty.\n'Oh my gosh, Texas, you've been sitting there for three hours,' Sora can't help but exclaim when she finds, after moving to Texas's side, that the form is still in the exact same shape as when she left.\nTexas gives a shrug of the shoulders, hands the pen to her, and makes it clear: Texas is checked out.\n'I'm busy sorting out the base! I can't help you with this,' Sora says, mouth curling to one side. 'Besides, it's not like this family stuff has anything to do with me—I'm just some performer.'\nTexas rolls her eyes. She'd finally laid out her whole past to her friends, and now it was nothing more than a harmless joke between them. She shoots a look at Croissant, but the Forte raises her hands as if to say she's all tied up herself. Still, something seems to hit her immediately after, and she pulls something out of a bag and slings it to Texas.\n'Bought it on the way. Think it over nice 'n slow, now—ya got plenty time 'n all.'\nTexas catches it, looks down, and finds it's a box of chocolates.\nHaving said her piece, Croissant heads into the kitchen. She's bought a bumper crop of cookware, and tonight will be her first time flexing her skills in Nuova Volsinii.\nSora switches a new record onto the gramophone. Melodious music fills the new base, while she begins to read the script she has in hand. She's gotten a new job, no doubt.\nExusiai's battle with her forms seems to be nearing a close, and one look at her face tells you she's pretty damn satisfied with what she's accomplished, but Texas knows the next time she fetches her weapons, she's not going to remember a single one of the names she thought up here.\nThis is my life now.\nTexas tears open the packaging, pulls out a stick and begins to slowly chew on it, but the feel of the chocolate as it gradually melts in her mouth, on top of everything she sees and hears and senses right now, leads to a moment of inspiration.\nShe promptly puts pen to form, fills in the name 'Blueberry & Dark Chocolate' a few times before tossing the pen aside.\nExusiai leans in to steal a glance, and bluntly tells her, 'I gotta say, partner, those are <i>really</i> stupid names.'\n'I agree.' Texas leans back in her office chair, gives her body a stretch, and puts her earphones on. 'But that's just the right amount of stupid.'",

          "description": "I hate the wooden dummy.\nIt's too big, too heavy, doesn't change in any way, and can't move on its own. No matter how you slash at it, it never hits back. As a training prop, it's stupidly ineffective, and doesn't fit most training purposes. They should throw anything with that little practical value straight in a trash bin.\nStop laughing. Believe me, inefficiency sickens me more than anyone else sitting here. Yes, I train on a wooden dummy every day, but I've had enough of even seeing it.\nOn the day I first wielded a katana, my first training target was half of a gigantic wooden dummy, taller than I was, so wide I couldn't pick it up. The grounds were covered in snow. They put the dummy dead center, in conditions where your only option for keeping your body temperature up was to brandish your katana as fiercely as you could. The order they gave me was that I wasn't allowed back inside to warm up by the heater until I cut it in half.\nThat day, I shattered six katanas, and cut through eight dummies.\nSince then, practically every day, I've faced off with my katana against dummy after dummy, throwing in the next once I've cut the last one to pieces. I still have the habit today.\nYou're sharp. Yes, it was 'practically' every day, and that's because I did stop once. Not long after I joined Rhodes Island, after participating in my first field mission.\nJust like you, I was hungry for victory on my first mission, but during it we hit an enormous snag. We were facing off against a highly experienced Caster. He was small, and with others covering for him, he was casting Arts like a ghost. We could barely put up a fight against it, and my katana couldn't threaten him in the slightest.\nIt was a painful defeat we swallowed. I was bitter about it as I came back, blaming my blade's helplessness for our loss. So I abandoned my routine, and spent the whole night reviewing recordings and deriving strategies to deal with the Caster's every move. Once I thought I was ready, I stowed away my katana, and took along a huge collection of new weapons to confront the Caster alone.\nBut in the end, I was defeated. It wasn't because my strategies were flawed, or because those new weapons were ineffective on him. It was because I hadn't spent nearly enough time training those strategies or using those weapons. All I did was assume it'd work, watch the recordings a few times, and head off for battle. Reality proved that hopelessly inefficient, and with a large chance of failure.\nAfter I came back, I restored the wooden dummy and began my routine again. It was just a plain dummy, and though I was sick of it, it was able to support me as I drilled my fundamentals and trained newly imagined moves, and that was enough.\nEveryone sitting here is an excellent operator about to take part in their first field mission. As Op Team A4 Captain, I, Yato, warn you all: never stop polishing your skills. That's the one and only path to high efficiency. Acting on assumptions is undesirable. Anything can happen on a fluke, but luck won't always have your back.\nA wooden dummy, a target, a mannequin, anything... smash it to pieces, and never stop. That's what you should be doing.\nAlright, I'm done... anything else?\nOh? You looked up the mission log? That's right, I did take out that Caster in the end.\nI said I failed—I did fail, with those new weapons. In the end, my final plan to settle things was to pull out my katana again, and with the most fleeting of chances, I slashed like I was slashing a dummy.\nAnd I cut that Caster down. End of story.",

In all the winding lines, you can vaguely make out the distribution of facilities aboard the Island. The Training Room's location has a giant red ring circled around it.)\nAfter Yato finishes training, be sure to check if equipment is broken. Call for repairs ASAP!\n......\nSection 5: Map of Lungmen\n(A map cut out of a newspaper, with Rhodes Island branch office and safehouse positions marked.)\nRemind Yato, go to office FIRST for any problems!\nNote: If we knock and no one answers, don't let Yato kick down the door!\n......\nPart 2: Illustrated Guide to Nasty as Hell Guys\n......\nSection 3: Infused Originium Slugs\n(An extremely blurry photograph.)\nOriginium Slugs with yellow light coming from belly. Trouble at first sight. Blows everywhere after you beat it up, hurts like hell, BE CAREFUL. Remind Yato, don't rush straight in to cut them down!\nWARNING: If she already did, get your shield the hell up!\n......\nSection 27: Metal Crabs\n(Hand-drawn images, remarkably abstract.)\nInfected creature that glows all over. Don't know what part of it's weak. Basically hack away at it until it's done.\nSPECIAL NOTE: Better to just let Yato at this one!\n......\nPart 3: How to Use Your Weapons\n......\nSection 2: Shield\n(An overview cut out from an encyclopedia accompanies this entry.)\nI know this one. Wherever the sound and light comes from, you block in that direction, get your team behind you, and then you don't fall one single step back.\n......\nPart 4: Because You Learn Something New Every Day\n......\nSection 53: How to Give Other People Reminders\nAnyone but Yato: Tell them straight up what to do and you're fine.\nYato: She's pretty hasty, probably won't take it in if you just tell her once. Gotta sit her down first, then walk her through the reasons, and once she understands you're smooth sailing.\n......\nSection 237: Watch Out For Sunlight!\nYato's skin gets damaged VERY easy by sunlight. When changing surroundings, watch for the position of sunlight, block it off for her.\nDoesn't seem to need it anymore with her new equipment. Good stuff.\n......\nSection 561: Yato's Birthday\nMay 14th.\nBuddy, you're just grinding out numbers now! BUT IF there's an accident on a mission and all suddenly you forget a bunch... Yeah, better note this down.\n......\nTitle Page: To Whoever Picked Up This Notebook\nThis is Noir Corne, notebook's owner. If you picked this up but can't find me, then hand this over to Yato from Rhodes Island.\nAlso, please tell her for me, if she runs into any trouble she can take a good flick through these notes. My way of helping her out even when I'm not there by her side.\nThanks.\n—Extracts from Noir Corne's Personal Notes",

Now, she too is a Very Important Person.\nIt's on the floor directly below Control's, sprawling with all manner of administrative and executive offices. Not that she's at all a stranger to this place, but today, it suddenly hits her that the AC is a little chilly, that her shoes are very loud against the floor, and that the looks the others give her... are harshly incisive.\nShe involuntarily lets out a sigh.\nFrom behind, one of the Defense employees looks at her and sees someone who began worrying for the future of Rhine Lab the moment she assumed her post, and he can't help but feel a level of respect for her.\nAt that precise moment, his terminal rings. It's a notice; he quietly says a few words in response and hangs up.\n'What's going on?'\n'It's nothing. Apparently someone sent something through Engineering's lines. My colleagues are tracing it down; no need for you to worry.'\nIn short order, they arrive at the office. The Defense personnel spend a few seconds operating the door like second nature, then give her the universal handsign for 'go ahead.'\n'Authenticated. Welcome, Components Control Executive Consultant Olivia Silence.'\nShe opens the door and enters.\nThe Defense personnel place her luggage on the coffee table, then take their leave at her nod.\nShe surveys her surroundings. A large, standard office, so empty that Ifrit could misbehave all she wants in here, with room to spare.\nBefore she can let out an even deeper sigh, the door behind her opens then shuts again with no warning.\n'Was there anything el—' She's suddenly compelled to swallow what she was saying, for her visitor is not a person, but—\n'A Meeboo?!' Yes, in front of her, without a doubt, sits one of Mayer's proud works.\nIt's carrying a bag on its back, containing a pouch of coffee beans, a mug, and an accompanying letter.\nShe opens it. It's Mayer's handwriting.\n'Boy have I been wondering what kind of gift to get you. Joyce told me she was gonna go for coffee beans, and eureka! So I remodeled one of my Meeboos a little.\n'You left while I was still working on it, and I was gonna mail it to you, but then Components Control said you'd already had a mountain in your inbox, and just the ETA on inspection was half a month, and I'm not waiting that long, so I borrowed Engineering's lines a little.'\nThere's a knock at the door.\nDammit, thinks Silence. If they find this Meeboo—\nShe lifts her head and sees it jump onto her new desk and, through a series of elaborate transformations, morph into a coffee machine.\nThe same Defense employee as before enters apologetically. 'Sorry, Ms. Silence, whatever was sent through the pipeline apparently arrived here. Is there anything in your office that, uh, can I ask what—\n'It's just a coffee machine,' Silence replies, shooting from the hip.\n'But...'\n'It was a gift from my friend to celebrate my promotion. Is something the matter?' Silence says, picking up the beans and pouring them into the Meeboo, before attempting to pour herself a practiced cup of coffee—er, it should be this button, she imagines? Oh, wonderful, she got it right.\n'Understood. As long as there's nothing out of the ordinary. Excuse me.'\nSuspicious no longer, the Defense employee turns and leaves.\nShe lets out a third sigh, this time of relief.\nHm. Right, the letter kept going.\n'I already told you at the farewell, but you know, might as well tell you one more time. Congrats on the promotion, Silence! I promise I'll swing by next time I'm back at HQ!'\nShe feels herself relax a little. Some things have changed, that much is true, but other things feel like they'll never change at all.\nAnd with this coffee machine around, she shouldn't having trouble staying awake, at least.",

We'll just have to cut it open down the middle, wipe it clean, then we can place that flower inside.'\n'Have you obtained the inhabitants' permission?'\n'Oren dragged a batch of supplies over when he sent the commandos, and these are the scraps the inhabitants don't need anymore. Leave it to me once we're on overtime—I don't want to see you cracking it open by hand.'\n'We have at most an hour before the monastery resumes its journey.'\n'We'll make it. That reminds me, though, Federico...'\n'What is it?'\n'I don't believe that gardener left a will.'\n'Monastery resident Clément Dubois has received an appropriate burial. He did not leave behind an executable will, nor any other personal estate.'\n'Um, you know I'm trying to ask, right?'\n'You wish to understand why I am preserving this flower.'\n'This isn't your first time handling an assignment with so much baggage, right? But I've never seen you leave a keepsake for yourself before... Are you doing okay?'\n'My assignment is complete. But there as still unaddressed doubts raised by the Sanctilaminium Ambrosii.'\n'If I'm remembering correctly, there was this quote from some Saint: 'A gun needs a target, but not every question can have an answer.''\n'I cannot overlook any issues. They will directly impact any followup assignments.'\n'*sigh* What am I even worrying over? Wait, don't tell me you questioned His Holiness when you went to report the mission progress?'\n'I did, but did not receive an answer.'\n'So that's why you're insisting on giving a nearly burnt-out flower another drying. Now I get it. Still, I have to say one thing—whether you can keep it preserved or not doesn't depend much on this glass bell I'm cutting. It's already dead. It's not the flower it was before, Federico.'\n'Richele, your word count in this conversation is significantly above-average.'\n'Ahaha, just making small talk. And I'm not even going to ask where you got that average from. Alright, it's settled—after we give this a wash, we'll stick it onto the pedestal. It'll be as pretty as what they sell in stores.'\n'Thank you.' Federico takes the grimy glass bell from his coworker's hands, and walks out of the junk-filled shed.\n'Well, then. What kind of answer will you find, Laterano's newest Saint?'",

I quote Beatrix Schwire's own words—the value of business is in building connections, and the greatest activity a business can undertake is connecting with the future.'\n—Award speech, Siesta's 1099 Annual Award for Outstanding Figures in Business\nCeylon Doykos personally awarded Swire this medal at Siesta City Hall's annual dinner, and now it's just one of a jumble of keepsakes she's brought back from Siesta to Lungmen.\n'You went to Siesta for a holiday, and took this home with you?' Hoshiguma asks curiously, poring over the Columbian on the certificate.\n'The greatest activity a business can undertake is connecting with the future'—I'm putting that in my autobiography.'\n'This certificate really tells a wild story... And you managed to do all this in just under two months? What does 'opened up international markets' mean exactly?'\n'Siesta's coffee beans were moving slow this year, so I made a few friends and sold off a massive shipment to Kazimierz—did you want to try some? I still have some in my bag.'\n'And can you translate 'an attitude that shows they care about the human side of things'?'\n'I did a little investing, and got the volcanic hot springs there transformed into a waterpark. Everyone seemed to take quite a liking.'\n'Okay, and 'a mindset for acute initiative' refers to...'\n'There were an awful lot of firms warring for Siesta's urban construction. Winning the final bid obviously took doing a little something to stand out.'\n'So how did you win?'\n'On vacation. Which is where that story is staying.'\n'Uh-huh...'\n'Stop reading that and help me sort my gifts out. This surfboard is for you, here's a volcanic mud cleanser for that stinky rat, here's a vinyl for that puk gaai lung—you know what, she can fetch it herself when she gets back—and here's some fruit cans for old Wei...'\nThe two spend all afternoon sorting through the pile of memorabilia, until finally, the only thing left lying forlornly on the ground is that medal.\n'Are you putting this on display? I don't know, your cabinet's already full with all your other awards...'\n'Forget it, this one can be a present for that sick old tiger—I'm visiting the hospital tomorrow, so I'll just give it to him myself.' Swire puts the medal away in her handbag, then stretches delightedly.\n'As the representative of Lungmen's future, I'm going to go connect with him.'",

You guys have to try their new poon choi. It's made traditionally, but the ingredients come from a new trade route that Mountaincomm Trade just opened. You'll get flavors from Rim Billiton to Sargon, and it's all super fresh. It even comes with a bottle of wine from Sami!\nSwire: Bison and I worked really hard to get this supply line up and running, so you all have to come! @Stinky Rat\nStinky Rat: Am I invited?\n17:09\nGuma: i'm starving. can we just go now?\nSwire: There aren't any seats yet. Have a snack to tide you over!\n18:32\nGuma: so hungry...\n19:20\nGuma: starving...\n19:58\nStinky Rat: Something just came up. You guys eat first.\n20:08\nSwire: Huh?\nSwire: What about Hoshiguma?\n20:23\nSwire: It's been ages since we all last met up—we HAVE to eat together. Finish up whatever it is you're doing, then decide where we're going to eat!\n20:41\nSwire: So, what are we gonna eat?\n21:19\nSwire: What are we eating tonight???\nSwire: Lin Yühsia, I can see you on read! Hurry up and pick a place!\nStinky Rat: I just finished up. Besides, you're the one who put out that 'Director Swire's Lungmen Food Guide'. It's been blaring nonstop on TV for three days. And I'm the one that has to pick the restaurant?\nGuma: sorry, emergency mission. done now. i'll eat whatever, as long as there's meat. i'm so hungry i could eat a burdenbeast\nStinky Rat: How about the night market? 'Right next to the shopping district, featuring specialty items from all over Terra. Shop at all of Terra, only in Lungmen!' Pretty good marketing copy, don't you think?\nSwire: Great choice! I have to promote my work, after all!\nGuma: doesn't sound like much meat. pass\nSwire: The volcanic mud cleansing face mask I gave you is on sale there too, @Stinky Rat. And the surfboard @Guma.\nSwire: Bison and I bargained day and night, and now they cost almost the same as they do in Siesta. Smart, huh?\nGuma: don't wanna eat a surfboard\nStinky Rat: How about the Global Commerce Park? It's second on your food guide list.\nSwire: That could work. We're working to attract investors over there, and we have a lot of international vendors now. The food's good too.\nGuma: i want meat, and that's over half an hour away. i'll starve on the way\nSwire: Well that's a shame. Young folks love that place—it's a top date spot!\nStinky Rat: Enough!\nStinky Rat: Final offer: the noodle cart behind the L.G.D. station. If that's no good, you two can starve.\nGuma: fine by me\nSwire: Fine by me.\n21:30\nSwire: Wait, Lin Yühsia, how did you get my food guide? Weren't you complaining about my TV ads?\nStinky Rat: I just grabbed one. Is that a problem?\n21:33\n Stinky Rat: How come the noodle cart isn't on your food guide?\nSwire: I wanted to include it, but the owner refused. He said something about how he didn't want his humble stall to be viewed as a sellout and lose its authenticity.\nSwire: Which is great, in my opinion. In the end, that's what Lungmen is all about.\n21:38\nGuma: i've already ordered. hurry up\n23:35\nGuma: why hasn't chen read a single message?\nSwire: Try the intercity net. She's probably standing on a pile of hay in the middle of nowhere, holding up her terminal to catch a signal.\n—New Message—\nPuk Gaai Lung: ...\nPuk Gaai Lung: It's a pile of rocks.\nPuk Gaai Lung: I'm back in Lungmen. I'm up for noodles.",

No cake crumbs, no cookie crumbs.'\n'I did! What are we gonna draw, Grandpa?'\n'Ooh... lookit here, I got a certificate, from when ol' Grandpa came back from the frontier. But they forgot to draw me a darn picture of the place. How about you help me fill that in, Jessica?'\n'Uhh... I've never been to the frontier, though...'\n'Your brother and your sisters went a whole bunch with your dad, didn't they? They ever tell you what was out there?'\n'They said the frontier's got nothing, but also said it's all... 'ripe for the picking.' I heard that, Grandpa, 'ripe for the picking,' but how do I draw it? I'm kind of lost...'\n'Aw, heck, they love to teach you some strange old words. Say, forget that, how about you draw something the likes of which they've never seen. I'll teach you. Remember how I told you of the Seven Bastards of the wastes, those catapulting Liberi robbers?'\n'Oh, yeah, yeah!'\n'Remember what that big ol' cactus was shaped like?'\n'Huge in every direction, like a mangler!'\n'Remember why tumbleweeds make a good wild bonfire?'\n'They're brambly and thin and they catch with a spark!'\n'Remember how to ride a burdenbeast?'\n'Pull the reins tight and straddle that saddle!'\n'Attagirl, Jessica. You always wanted to know more, see more, just like your brother and sisters? You ask me, I bet my bottom dollar you'll be just like them once you're as grown up as them, oh the things you'll know and see. But Grandpa's personal little tales, I've not yet told a soul but you, Jessica. They don't know 'em—heck, your dad doesn't know 'em.'\n'Okay! When they come back, I'll tell them, then I'll show them my picture, and it's gonna blow their socks off! 'Wow, Jessica, you heard stories we never got to hear!''\n......\nShe pulls the burdenbeast's reins, straddles the saddle, and unfolds an old sheet of paper in the light of the sinking sun.\nJust about below the edge of the wastes, its last warm rays shine through the paper. A sheen, she might swear, casts over faded fountain ink.\nThe old man trots his burdenback alongside her. She yanks the reins tight, and settles back in her seat.\n'What's that you're peeking at, Jessica?'\n'It's... a picture, something I drew when I was real young, of the frontier.'\n'You came out here as a kid? Never mentioned that.'\n'No, I just had someone describe it to me. Held my hand while I was drawing.'\n'Not half bad, all things considered. Hell of a 'canvas' too.'\n'This is his certificate, the one who showed me how to draw it. He was my grandfather.'\n'Your grandfather. A hero of the states?'\n'Yeah... a hero of the states. And a hero of mine.'",

He remembers his promise to the King of Sarkaz, the reason for his travels: to bring his scattered kind back to Kazdel, and he would be the very last.\nBut what is this endless golden expanse before his eyes? A desert, an ocean, or one of infinite Kazdels?\nThe suit of armor is sinking. The delineation between body and sand blurs, just as he can no longer distinguish between what he thinks and what is true. When the sand completely covers his head, he will disappear for good.\n'Tap, tap tap.' \nA tapping sound comes from the top of his head.\nPerhaps it is just a fowlbeast hoping to find food in the bits of grass growing there.\n'Clang—clang—'\nThe sand entombing him begins to shift.\nNo, it is not the sand that is moving. Someone is kicking him. From the sound of things, someone is treating him—the eldest revenant, the first guardian of Kazdel, chief advisor to all Kings of Sarkaz—as a ball to be punted around.\n'You—'\n'Can you hear me? If you can, then stop playing dead. I've been lugging you around for so long, you'd better start pulling your weight. Otherwise, I'll pawn you off as scrap metal when I get back!' \n'...What do you want?'\n'Whoa, you've sure mellowed out. Back when you had that big ol' body, didn't your vocabulary consisted mostly of words like 'hatred', 'flee', and 'wretched outbloods'? I was worried for a sec that you were even more illiterate than me and those were the only words you knew.\n'To think Her Highness chose someone so crass...'\n'Now that's what I'm talking about. But no rush to get back to your old self. Time to get to work.'\n'Doing what exac—?'\nBefore he could finish, he was already up in the air.\n'Is that enough? Or do I need to throw in more explosives?'\nHe is flying.\nFlying high, high above the dunes, over the ruins, until—\nKazdel.\nA place he thought he would never see again.\nWith the way he's going, he'll soon crash into the meeting hall of the former Royal Court, the place where he once made a promise to King Yliš using all the remaining soulflame of his people—\n'Wiš'adel, *Sarkaz cursing*—!\n'Haha, that eager to curse yourself, o venerated ancestor?' The young Sarkaz laughs mirthfully. 'Go on then. Use that rage, blow everything up, and once you've gotten rid of all that junk, I'll take you home.'",

'I'm more than glad to take on the responsibility, but I'm worried I'm not qualified to lead.' She confided these thoughts to her teammates.\nOne night, during a combat simulation, Reserve Op Team A1 was completely 'annihilated.' At the time, Fang had discovered a flaw in the opponent's tactics and thought that if she ran fast enough, she could penetrate deep behind enemy lines to split their attention and reduce the suppression fire on Beagle, thus creating more space and time for her team to retaliate. So she changed the strategy on-the-fly and used something her teammates had never practiced. The result: Team wipe. Even Fang was sent to the sickbay for treatment.\n'Why did you push yourself like that?' asked Ace, an elite operator who had taken the time to guide the rookies.\n'Because I'm the captain, so I have to take responsibility for the entire team.'\n'Responsibility, huh...? Responsibility.'\n'Sir, if you were leading the team, what would you have done?'\n'I'd have gone with a safer strategy.'\n'Why?'\n'Don't be hasty. Observe, act, and accumulate experience. That's what I always do.'\n'But you're already an elite capable of leading entire squads.'\n'Which is why I know full well that, on the battlefield, a commander only has one chance to bear full responsibility.' The man falls silent for a moment. ' So we ought to use it wisely.'\n'I don't quite understand, but I'll try to keep that in mind.' Fang continued, 'So please teach me to be a better captain! I'll commit to it, no matter how much work it takes!'\n'Let's continue this conversation once you've recovered from your injuries, young captain.' Ace waved goodbye before leaving.\nFollowing this incident, Fang indeed underwent rigorous training. When all was said and done, Ace handed her a box and told her this: 'For a captain, the most important thing is to remain calm and collected. Your long-term training task is learning to be patient. And your reward for that is here in this box.'\nAs for what happened next...\nFang snaps back to reality and re-evaluates her current status. On the day she became an official operator, she felt she wasn't ready. On the day she received her second promotion, she still felt she wasn't ready. Now, she is about to head to Londinium to support the operators there. She has been through dozens of operations, some easy, some dangerous. Some short, some long. She has overcome difficulties and experienced failure. Now, she feels she has finally finished her training task and tempered herself.\nShe opens the box and finds a pair of wind protection glasses with a note inside:\n'May you always keep your eyes on your duty and forever be dauntless.'",

          "description": "Kal'tsit pauses at the door of the command center.\n'Dr. Kal'tsit?' The girl inside takes notice.\nShe lifts her head in an attempt to catch Kal'tsit's gaze. However, stacks of files sprawled across the conference table obscures most of her face, revealing only the tips of a pair of fluffy ears.\n'The leader of the Leithanian convoy did not object to our terms.' Kal'tsit listens as she moves towards the girl, gathering the scattered files. 'That doesn't mean they'll agree to all of them.'\n'Right. While they were polite during the negotiations, the way they looked at me felt... cold and menacing.' The girl winces, as if still feeling the sting of their sugar-coated animosity.\n'Try not to—'\n'—be influenced by the emotions of others, especially their negative ones. I understand.' The girl's smile is reassuring. 'Don't worry. I've already put them under the surveillance of Mantra's squad. Logos assured me that if they harbored any ill intentions towards Rhodes Island, their hands would be frozen to their staffs before they could even cast.'\nLogos likely tempered his rhetoric when describing the devastating effects of his Arts to protect this young girl. It has become a common practice among the Operators, who adjust to her leadership while subconsciously taking her as a child who needs protection. Yet anyone who assumes that eleven-year-old Amiya needs protection is soon taken aback by her shrewdness and meticulous nature.\nYoung Amiya is growing quickly. She has already outgrown her bespoke dress from three months ago, and the rate at which her mind expands is even more remarkable. There were times when Kal'tsit felt that each day, the Amiya she saw was slightly different from the day before. She wasn't sure if it was merely a hallucination or if the influence of Civilight Eterna on Amiya hadn't been completely subdued.\n'Dr. Kal'tsit...' Amiya's voice softened, like a pin dropping in a silent room. 'I've been dreaming again.'\n'What did you dream about?'\n'I dreamed of... a person. She sat next to me, held my hand, and spoke of many things. Some were from my past, while others seemed like experiences yet to come.'\n'The future?'\n'Umm... Maybe. She told me that in a massive nomadic city with steel high walls, a terrible war will break out. Many, especially the Sarkaz, will perish, and black rocks will spread everywhere.'\n'And as she spoke of these things, she was...'\n'She was so very upset, but she was strong and didn't keep crying. She said she would never give up and that the future would become better.'\nKal'tsit extends her hand to the little girl. In the past year, the deceased have not been a topic commonly discussed. Perhaps Amiya still needed comfort to cope with her losses.\n'Amiya, it is only natural to miss those we've lost. You need not suppress your feelings for Theresa.'\n'Well... I do miss Theresa a whole lot, but it wasn't her in my dream.' Amiya's eyes widen. 'Dr. Kal'tsit, I think... the person in my dream was me.'\nKal'tsit is slightly taken aback by this revelation, but before she can respond, Amiya has already rushed forward and embraced her.\n'All this talking has made me hungry.' The young girl shakes Kal'tsit's hands, her eyes shining with a precious look. She begins to drag Kal'tsit along, her voice bubbling with excitement. 'Dr. Kal'tsit, won't you keep me company?'\n'What should we get? Baked beans sound nice. Mr. Scout said that adding carrots would make them sweeter...'\n'Brr... Ursus sure is cold. Do you think those who sit around all day feel cold too?'\n'Say, Dr. Kal'tsit, do you ever... Dr. Kal'tsit...'\nKal'tsit holds onto Amiya's hand, allowing herself to be led. As Amiya's cheerful chatter fills the air, Kal'tsit finds herself lost in thought—\nClosure has done an impressive job with the landship. The lights in this corridor are so much brighter now.",

Subsequently, thermite blade's power will be greatly increased. \nWell, huh... Looking at things this way, Originium only sucks when it acts up and hurts a lot. But other than that, it doesn't get in the way of my life, and can even help me in battle. Isn't that pretty decent? \nHmm, maybe that's what I'll tell the teacher’s pet the next time I see her. Can't wait to see what kind of face she makes. \nWonder how she'd even respond to that... \n'Your health isn't some kind of game!' \n'What's so decent about that? You're actually going to die!' \nSheesh, what's the big deal anyway? You only live once, right? So why not enjoy it? \n'Didn't you say you wanted to go traveling across the world? With Oripathy...' \n...... \n...... \nYeah, about that travel planner... \nI'm not gonna get to check off a lot of things from my bucket list. \nIt sucks that I didn't even make it through a tenth of my list before getting sick. And some of the places still on it don't welcome the Infected at all. The vast tundras of Ursus, Londinium's eclectic manors, Leithanien's concert halls, Kazimierz's knight tournament arenas, the thousands of fowlbeasts sweeping across Sargon's deserts... \nI wanted to see all of them, with her. \nMight as well cross them out now... \nJeez, why am I thinking about all these things anyway... It's all because of that teacher’s pet. I listen to her nagging too much. Even when she's not here, I hear her voice in my head. \nStop thinking about these things. \n...... \nLet's keep those plans after all. \nRhodes Island is still moving forward, so I have to keep moving forward. \nMaybe one day... \nJust maybe, those places will open their doors to welcome the Infected.",

Do you read me—'\n'...[KZZT]...[KZZT]...'\nThey laid an Arts trap specifically to separate us. Seems they aren't taking chances with our teamwork.\nShe takes a headcount of the nearby hostiles. Five left, three right, seven dead ahead, for 15 total. All Vouivre, all kitted with blackout sunglasses and insulated shields.\nOkay, then. They know us too well. They were expecting us.\nWe used to run into gangs and bandits here, drifters. This is different. They're organized, equipped, and tactical. They've been trained by a professional. Who?\n'Why is this the way you come home to Vouivre, Blacksteel merc?'\nThe voice came from deep in this ruined skyscraper, and been altered by Originium Arts. Whoever's talking doesn't plan to expose their identity. For now.\nThe enemy's formed a circle. The shade-and-shield guys are trotting in. Good, just a little closer.\nI bring up my shield, feeling heat gather at my horntips. I fill up my chest. My pulse and breathing both skip a beat. I shut my eyes, and thunder claps about my ears. I open my eyes again, momentarily dazed.\n'You see now? Vouivre's not the same place you left.'\n'Her Arts failed! Get her!' Ahead, the hostiles' insulated shields are scorched and blistered, and they've let their guard down. Good.\nI unclip the lightweight device from my tactical vest. I remember what the Engineering ops named it. The Experimental Photocapacitive Grenade. My 'Stunner's Storage'.\nWith my fingertip as a casting medium, the photocap's Originium circuits make a crack like a bullet. I toss it through the air, and my ears ring yet again.\nThe cramped ruins flash with another round of blinding light, and the photocap's stored current arcs through the air and the seared shields. The hostiles yell as they go down. Fifteen voices.\n'Good shit, Blacksteel merc. So you brought these little toys back to Vouivre?'\n'I know what I'm here to bring back.\n'But before I do, I want you the hell out of Vouivre first!'",

I figured you'd rather improve its healing efficacy, or maybe durability.'\n'I probably would have thought along those lines in the past, yes.'\nMagallan doesn't say anything. She may spend her days in the tundra year in and year out, but that doesn't mean she's completely clueless about Rhine Lab's internal affairs.\n'I initially wanted nothing more than to be a researcher. I sought to thoroughly analyze the relationship between Originium and life, and I assumed I'd pry open the boundaries of knowledge with my own two hands.\n'But following a string of incidents, I could no longer ignore this: as long as my research doesn't change course, I will never be able to completely exclude the 'human' perspective.\n'Before I started a new job, I first needed to stand in the shoes of a doctor, from where I could examine my own dreams and ambitions. The most basic respect you can afford someone, as I see it.\n'Those drones, then, are the crystallization of my ideology.'\nThe two inadvertently share a glance towards the workshop. Mayer is inside racking her brains; entering hastily was very liable to get you bitten.\n'Speaking as a layman in medicine, I think these drones are already perfect as an extension of a doctor's hands.'\n'Perhaps, but I've increasingly come to realize that merely serving as a doctor... is still not enough.'\nSilence's expression is complicated. She lightly touches her hair.\n'Humans are far more complex than Originium.\n'We can roughly determine Originium activity from its surface appearance. We can predict the ETA of Catastrophes from natural phenomena. We can avoid infection through highly effective protective measures.\n'But how do we determine a person's interior life from what's visible to us? Do falling figures signify deterioration or improvement? Are people with crossbows ultimately there to defend, or to kill?'\n'Just like a snowfield that seems perfectly quiet,' Magallan murmurs to herself.\n'Yes, just like a snowfield that seems perfectly quiet.\n'Therefore, I need tougher measures, so that when the snowfield finally bares its fangs at me, I can protect the people I should be protecting.'",

After the intense battle, everyone is visibly exhausted. She reminds her teammates to watch out for an ambush, but not a moment after she finishes—and before her teammates had time to react—the ambushers have already emerged from behind the boulders.\nThe very next moment, the fog that clouds the barrenland is immediately split asunder by the blinding flash of Originium Arts, forcing the ambushers to take a step back.\nIt seems casting the Arts was too much for Gitano to bear, giving her a spell of dizziness and a burning sensation at the source of her infection. 'You can't keep using your Originium Arts like that.' The advice she got from her tribespeople years ago echoes in her ear. 'Your body can't withstand it anymore. You'll fall ill if you keep casting them.'\nNonetheless, she has pushed herself to her limits in the tundra more times than she can count. With the responsibilities she shoulders, she's never been one to fear falling ill.\nSome time later, she faintly overhears two men talking in hushed voices.\n'Shh—It's okay. She fell asleep because she's tired. Her infection hasn't gotten worse. Don't worry.'\n'We have her to thank for reacting so quickly, otherwise we wouldn't have made it back in one piece.'\n'How did she foresee the ambush, though? If she's really able to peek into the future, wouldn't she also know that—'\n'Don't be stupid. She herself often says that destiny is something that can be changed.'\n'Will you really resist the guidance of fate itself?' All those years ago, her tribespeople implored her. 'We need to turn around. We don't want to leave our homeland, and we've already paid a dear price.'\nBut the young fortune teller kept leading them onward.\n\nThe Rhodes Island transport pulls out of the site with the team, after their successful rescue mission. The Elafia holds tightly onto her crystal ball as she sleeps on the stretcher. She dreams of the black forest back home and the bitter, salty snowdrops, as well as the silhouettes of the mountain chains peeking above the horizon. She's never turned around, nor can she ever go back.",

Or is this her Originium Arts?\nI am starting to be scared.\nShe seems to have noticed how disturbed I am.\nShe smiles and starts comforting me, telling me that this is just a part of her Arts.\nAs she says that, a tiny creature appears on her palette.\nShe tells me that this is her 'assistant.'\nThe critter may not seem like it's capable of making any sounds that are less than pleasant, but I seem to be able to hear some strange noises whispered into my ears.\nI do have to admit, though. It looks really cute.\nIt's leaping back and forth between the canvas and the paint every now and then.\nIt seems it's helping Deepcolor finish this painting.\n'So that's your assistant!'\nI can't help myself but to exclaim.\nShe nods.\nShe's smiling.\n......\nHow time flies; the painting has already been completed.\nShe hands the painting to me, and I pay her the commission we'd agreed upon.\n'You'll love this portrait for sure!'\nShe seems really happy.\nOf course, I am happy too. After all, what is there to be unhappy about when a painter hands you a freshly painted portrait, especially one so lifelike?\nThe colors are bright and vivid, and the expression is true and genuine.\nThis is magnificent!\nAs I mount the painting, a question suddenly comes to mind.\nThough it was on my mind just moments earlier, I immediately forgot about it when I laid my eyes on the painting.\n'Has she ever used any colors other than blue?'\n'Where did that discomforting noise come from?'\nWho cares?\nReally, who cares?!\nIt's not nice to pry into somebody else's secrets!\nEven if something might seem off, what does that have anything to do with me?",

          "description": "Vina sits atop the roof, staring at the clouds above that hang ever crushingly low. It's a month in Londinium where rain comes every evening. Not too badly; it's a fine drizzle, nothing that inconveniences anyone rushing home from work, but it stirs the scent of the ground into the air. Rotting wood, the rankling smell of fins, and needless to say, sweat. The Borough of Norbert never smells much like a part of Londinium. All the bigger logistics warehouses have relocated to the north side, and the factories and markets have gone with, leaving behind a plate full of refuse no other borough wants, and the people with nowhere else to go.\nA shout comes from the boxing gym downstairs—sounds like Indra's won again. It's a night of celebration for the Glasgow Gang. Vina led the lot charging into the underground casino on Mariner Road this afternoon, and scared the Ronnie brothers right out of Norport wholesale. After that, the buildings surrounding were all Glasgow's. Morgan got all worked up and hefted barrels of booze over—needed to celebrate properly, according to her. Said she got this stuff from that top fancy pub on the corner, paid loads for it. Got Baird worried she'd been taken in. With enough drink down them, the lot all paraded up arm in arm and chanted her name, 'Siege,' so loud the whole street could hear.\nHow much of a conqueror does subduing a few gangs really make you? When she first got that name, Vina honestly could've laughed or died of embarrassment, maybe both. None of Indra's lot knew her background, and she wasn't even hiding it on purpose, she just never found the right time to share all. Norbert and Auchterigg were like two different countries—no one cared whose parents were who here. The most was the one time, when the police got hold of some Glasgow and brought them into the station. It was routine questioning from the coppers—what race was she? She stared that officer beaming from ear to ear dead in the eye, and on some ridiculous impulse, answered 'Aslan.' That threw him for a loop, and then he had her by the scruff, trying to tug her head into the table. Vina sat calm, didn't bend her neck one bit. Oh, he turned red. His hands shook and shook, as tends to happen on a diet of grease and drink, until he finally turned from trying violence to harsh words instead. Threatened her saying she wouldn't step out of this station for the rest of the month talking daft shit like that, the piddling hoodlum she was. She was out the next day. Morgan and Indra fetched her there, Indra telling her how she sent a Baron's boys running for the hills with a Molotov, Morgan saying she had to mediate like crazy, and it cost a pretty penny. Past the street corner, Vina couldn't help but take a look back. Absolutely nothing there watching her, no people nor giant creatures. That flash of gold must've just been the sun blinding her eyes.\nVina couldn't tell you how long she's gone without seeing Gawain now. Her teacher might well be everywhere at once. At a fried fin stand, mingling in the boxing gym, maybe up in the clouds above. Could be anywhere. The moment that occurs to her, something makes her twitch for no reason at all, and unconsciously, she goes to reach for another bitter lollipop to stick in her mouth. But once she does, she finds the metal box emptied. Completely vacant and light as a feather. Somehow, someway, her heart feels just as airy, like she's losing her balance. She'd better find something heavier to shove in there next time, Vina thinks. Wouldn't go wrong with some rivets from the construction site.\nSomewhere behind, Baird calls for her. Shoving her candy box back in her trouser pocket, Vina grins a little and turns around, sauntering back over to the clamor of voices that was, is, and will be Siege's.",

          "description": "Gawain ambles through the city. He's spent so much time in this manner, yet still can't say he's used to seeing what he sees. Londinium's clouds are hanging low as ever—when did that start happening? He strains to recall, but can't come up with a definite answer. As if the last time he looked to the sky, the gloomy haze was never even there.\nAlexandrina Vina Victoria lies sleeping on the counter in the pub. Yesterday, she and her companions made an all-too-tough escape from the beat. It strikes Gawain that she especially resembles her grandmother in these moments—or was it her great-grandmother? The one named Mathilda, the girl with a head of gold curls, how exactly was she related to Vina here? Face after face flashes by, going from young to old, ultimately scattering with the sand on the wind. Some of those faces might not even actually exist, being simply products of vaguer parts of the mind. Gawain has to admit, his time spent by this family's side may be longer than he was anticipating at first. Far longer already.\nHe doesn't make a habit of appearing before people. The interpretations of him as a symbol of power disgust him, and hardly fall in line with his original agreement. Still, their ups and downs have kept Gawain watching with interest all the same. There'll be times he can't help but reflect on history. Moments where shadows of similarity loom over them.\nVina once asked him why her teacher would always be by her side, and at the time his answer was silence. Yes, he learned long ago not to meddle anymore, because farewell would always come eventually. He still dimly remembers how, once, he and Lugalszargus bounded about that battlefield they call the foehn hotlands these days. He carried that mettlesome man atop his back, and with the Nightzmoran Khagan by their side, they charged for the sandstorms of afar. Everyone died there—and that was the news he brought back to Lugalszargus's daughter. He remembers the feeling of his mane wet with tears. Those times proved... to pass in the twinkling of an eye. Humanity is far frailer than a master of the beasts, and the years have taught him that fact again and again.\nSome bygones aren't worth dredging up so often, and Gawain only recalls those periods very, very occasionally in his dreams. A meeting so old that history had not yet been written, a reckless boy upon the barrens who never feared him one bit. Their travels together, cheers and tears, song and wine, and then—his age, his death. That was the first time, not as a sovereign, but as a friend, that Gawain witnessed death. Warmth fading from flesh, breath stilling from mouth and nose. Before that, Gawain had never imagined that to witness death would be such torment.\nIt was then that Gawain promised him, that he would aid his descendants in their continued survival, until they no longer needed him.\nThe golden creature stops in his step, and narrows his eyes. He, that friend, that boy... what was his name?\nGawain sighs. Fortunately, he still hasn't abandoned his vow.",

          "description": "The mercenary's bag has an interlayer, and within it go things she doesn't normally bring out.\nYoung, wandering children are all too common a sight across these lands, most clinging onto their bitter lives. A little girl pleads with a group of monsters, hoping to be spared some food.\n'Please, please, help me!' says the little girl, 'I can do a lot of things, I can help you too.'\nThe monsters take pity on this wasteland vagabond, and they accept her, allowing her into a small den she can call home.\n'You're so nice!' she says, with her tiny cloth bundle. 'I can hunt—I'll bring back even more food for you.'\nThe skies grow dark, and dark means unsafe. She shrinks into her hiding spot, looking out at the dim sky.\n'We don't have enough food. You said you would hunt. Now's the time.' The leader of the squad of monsters brushes its hair out of its eyes, and says to the girl, 'Bring back more food.'\nThe girl journeys out alone into the dark, and all the creatures under the night sky tuck themselves away, leaving her with nothing. But, far in the distance, she catches sight of a small campfire, a bag of food full enough for several days, and a seemingly very listless mercenary.\n'Take it.' The thought pops into her head. Finally, she reaches out and manages to grasp the bag. Inside is something she hasn't eaten in a long time—real food.\nSnatch it, steal it, whatever it takes. Getting it is the only way the monsters will recognize her; taking it is the only way they will let her stay. She clutches it tight and starts to run.\nWith the mercenary giving chase, the girl runs all the way back to the squad of monsters, and they rush at the mercenary, claws out.\nBut the wails she imagines never come. The mercenary seems to be saying something in a loud voice. The girl peeks out from behind the bonfire. The mercenary takes the monsters once more into the black night, and after a brief departure, they come back.\nThe monsters are delighted, crying out in celebration, as they haul a modest convoy of supplies out from the night. Time passes, growing darker still, and it comes time to rest.\nThe girl lies down in relief, the mercenary takes watch duty, and after they are done celebrating, the monsters too sleep beside the bonfire.\nShe takes stock of this newcomer, and the newcomer returns her gaze. After a brief moment of eye contact, she turns away and shuts her eyes.\nThe monsters murmur as they dream, and the mercenary adds some wood to the fire. Only one pair of eyes is open, glinting in the flames, and they size up the camp.\nWhen the only sound to be heard by the bonfire is steady breathing, the girl opens her eyes.\nOnce all the other sounds completely disappear, she emerges from her hiding spot.\n'We make a good team.' In the mercenary's hand is a blade, slicked with a liquid, thick and red. The girl looks around, taking in the state of the camp.\nShe finds a patch of ground to sit down on, still more or less clean. The mercenary starts moving the things back to their camp, and, left alone, she looks up at the moons.\n'...Traitor!' The sole remaining monster charges out from some corner, breath ragged and letting out an incomprehensible voice. It grapples the girl.\n'I'm going to die like this,' thinks the girl as she struggles desperately. 'I can't die.'\nA hole is made in her little bundle; a shard of a blade cuts through the cloth in her grip and slices her hand. She grips this shard tight, and thrusts it into the night over and over, until the monster can no longer hold of its weapon. Thick, sticky, red liquid trickles to the floor.\nSurvive.\nInside the interlayer of the mercenary's bag is the shard of a blade, something she placed in there even before she was a mercenary.",

I've heard that the ship's master will give us sanctuary.'\nThe slave nervously prostrated himself on the ground, offering his only weapon.\n'Who are you?' The mercenary didn't even look at him.\n'I'm an escaped slave from the Scar Market. I accidentally injured a guard and can't go back, but I want to live.'\nThe mercenary gazed at the campfire in silence for a moment. 'I know where the giant ship will pass tomorrow. After daybreak, I'll take you there.'\nThe slave expressed gratitude to the mercenary, set down his weapon, and attempted to sleep where he stood.\nThe one-armed guard shuffled through the starlit wasteland, spotting the silent mercenary by a campfire in the distance.\n'I'm searching for an unstoppable giant ship in the wilderness. I've heard that the ship's owner will give us sanctuary.'\nThe guard nervously stood still, holding no weapon to protect himself.\n'Who are you?' The mercenary didn't even look at him.\n'I'm an escaped guard from the Scar Market. I let a slave go out of compassion and can't go back, but I'm willing to serve a new master.'\nThe mercenary gazed at the campfire in silence for a moment. 'I know where the giant ship will pass tomorrow. After daybreak, I'll take you there.'\nThe guard expressed gratitude to the mercenary, concealed his severed arm, and tried to sleep where he stood.\n'However, only one of you can go.' The mercenary stood up, a disgusted expression illuminated by the campfire.\nIn the firelight, the slave and the guard saw each other's eyes.\n'I'll be back after daybreak.' The mercenary left the camp and vanished into the starlit wilderness.\nWhen the first beam of light fell upon the wastes, the mercenary returned to the extinguished campfire.\nBoth the guard and the slave had disappeared, leaving behind only a lone weapon.\nWith the weapon in hand, the mercenary returned to the giant ship. The giant watching the gate was curious about their fate.\n'I don't care. They were never qualified to serve Her Majesty.'\n'And what's your standard, how are you so sure?' The giant playfully teased the mercenary.\n'For as much as she's ever reprimanded me, she never considered kicking me out.' The mercenary laughed and said, 'The standard, of course, is me.'",

          "description": "Behind Zima's back, someone gently prods her with a finger.\nShe doesn't turn to look. She knows, instinctively, that it's Istina reminding her that her earphones are on too loud.\nZima likes to listen to music, and especially cherishes an electronic genre popular among the Ursus youth known as 'hardbass,' the pumping rhythm and heart-shaking bass of the tracks always fires her up, and her limbs can hardly resist the urge to fill with the beat—a desire to throw hands and feet and bust down the joyless everyday, an eagerness to free her tied-up mind always ready to color her soul.\nThere was a time where she'd sometimes wear earphones in battle too, grooving to the rhythm and stepping to the beat while cleaning up bandit nobodies.\nFollowing one training session, Dobermann sternly pointed out to her that 'as I see it, you're simply venting your violence.'\nZima sneered at that, and nothing more. Anyone could tell she wasn't the impulsive girl she seemed, for she could distinguish between people she could openly challenge verbally without fear of blowback—like the Doctor—and people who really cared about the rules, for whom rebellion was best kept internal.\nFor youth like her, knowing that distinction was one of the principles of survival.\nHer other instructor thought differently.\nNearl was by no means strict with Zima's attitude, but the Kazimierz knight's invulnerability and tacit, solid endurance left Zima frustrated and powerless.\nNearl even listened to a few of her favorite tracks and told her 'It's fine music. Very full of energy.'\nZima eyed her somewhat warily at that. 'You gonna lecture me or something?'\nThe knight of Kazimierz shook her head.\n'No. Whatever music you listen to, I have no objections.'\nThat was nice enough, but what came next was less pleasing to hear.\n'But you still lack the strength to allow yourself to be distracted in battle. If you wish to earn a passing grade from me, this won't do.'\nZima couldn't help but glare at her.\n'I will hold on to your player and earphones for now.' The knight of Kazimierz paid no mind to General Zima's fury; instead calmly speaking words she had never heard before, now even from her parents. 'Come now, no need for that frown. I'll spar with you using one hand; once you can best me like that, and are qualified to lead a team, I'll gift you a new set.'\n'Kazimierz's latest model. I've no doubt you'll like it.'\n'......'\nGeneral Zima traces her hand over the latest Kazimierzian communicator-slash-player on her wrist, without a word cutting off the music she had playing and switching it over to access her squad's comms channel.\nHer teammates chatter away, the mix of voices no less relaxed than the pumping hardbass rhythm.\nZima listens for a while, not realizing she's unconsciously moving her leg, tapping out a rhythm.\nIn her head now spins a rhythm more passionate, more fervent than her most beloved of tunes.\nAlright, Zima has to admit, she <i>does</i> like this new model a lot—\nShe's all fired up, and doesn't even need any music.",

I wanted to help Harmonia with these, but the medicine I make doesn't even work to treat a headache. I can't do anything for her... If we hadn't been found by a Rhodes Island operator, Harmonia would be gone by now.'\nThe Feline sits down on a chair, and calmly regards the Vulpo.\n'I'm just so useless... Harmonia caught Oripathy because of me, and I can't even ease her pain...'\n'Not necessarily.'\n'Thank you, but you don't need to comfort me—'\n'That wasn't my intent. How did you have her take these remedies? Directly?'\n'I know a whole set of ways of processing herbs, but none of the finished products did anything at all.'\n'Try making some.'\nBlearily, the Vulpo lifts her head.\n'Try making some here. If you feel conditions are lacking, you may borrow a Rhodes Island pharmaceutical laboratory.'\n'N-No, that's fine, I can just make it here.'\n\nThe Vulpo blows her nose, and quickly enters work mode, using the herbal tools she carries with practiced hands.\nDry, chop, grind, soak, percolate.\nShe wastes no time at all. In a scant ten minutes, as exact as a machine, she has turned the herbal remedy into a sparkling liquid in a test tube.\n'What color is the liquid in the test tube?'\n'It's a very pretty green.'\n'Has the liquid you've extracted always been that color?'\n'I want to say yes, but also... I'm not sure. Harmonia was so sick, and I was in such a rush making so much per batch, I never stopped to note what color it was...\n'Make it again.'\nIn short order, herbal liquid fills a second test tube.\n'Keep making it, and do not stop. Continue until all the test tubes in front of you are filled with this medication.'\nFeeling gratitude to Rhodes Island, the Vulpo stifles the doubt in her heart, and busies herself as directed.\n\nThe sun falls past the horizon.\nShe is finally free to look at the results of her efforts, but the sight before her leaves her stupefied.\nThe medicines are all lined up in a row, every tube labeled with a time. The older they are, the more their color has deepened, first to as dark green as a forest, then finally to a complete black, as if a kind of grave hint.\nThe Feline stands up.\n'People wish to use medicine to extend the lives of others—an eternally praiseworthy effort. However, they always forget that the life of a drug is often far briefer than a human's.'\n'Keep in mind the brevity of life, and the Rhodes Island Medical Department will open its doors to you.'",

          "description": "Heavy snow, a bamboo forest.\nAn emaciated figure dives in, staggering; this is where she's concealed herself the whole way. She thinks to dig out some winter bamboo shoots to stave off her hunger, to take a few mouthfuls of snow to allay her thirst.\nThe bamboo forest is a fine place to hide, but she's not the only one who knows that. A dozen or so shinobi are in cover here, tasked with ensuring that this girl, the last survivor to escape from the purge of her family, does not remain so.\nThe bamboo leaves rustle, and the branches up high drift up and down in the wind.\nTheir tips shudder, shaking free small clumps of snow, which scatter in a slicing gust before they ever touch the ground, becoming a fine wintry mist and disappearing into the air. A few fowlbeasts on another stalk retract their necks, stuck out moments prior, and fold their wings up again, relaxing and continuing to huddle close.\nAll is still.\nThe bony girl lifts her head.\nSuddenly, a white glint.\nA dart at odds with her build flies from her hand, snowflakes and wind whirling alongside. This weapon has seen plenty of use thus far; now, it makes a clean cut yet smashes to pieces a bamboo leaf big enough to conceal someone.\nThe struck shinobi lets out a short cry, and powdery snow explodes off the layers of leaves. A trap prepared long in advance cuts off the girl's retreat. She leaps atop a branch, before being forced back by the flash of a descending blade. Her weakness from days without food catching up to her, she loses her grip on the branch, and drops like a stone. But undeterred, she looses one final arrow from her sleeve in midair.\nIt finds itself with no target to hit, but both her and the shinobi crash to the ground at practically the same time, with a dull thud. She lifts her head, and before her is a Lung dressed in black, brandishing a naginata right behind the shinobi.\n'So this is where you were, girl?'\nThe girl stares blankly, not knowing how to respond.\n'I am Fumizuki,' she says, patting the girl's head. 'Can you use a blade?'\nThe girl comes to her senses, and nods. She grasps a handful of snow from the ground, stuffs it in her mouth and swallows, draws a spare tantou from Fumizuki's waist, and charges at her enemy within the forest. Fumizuki watches this frail girl leave, and quickly follows behind.\nOne, then two. From sun overhead to horizon-laid, the shadows amidst the bamboo fall without even a chance to signal their backup. When the final shinobi uses the last of their strength to charge the girl, aiming a hidden shot straight at her stomach, Fumizuki pushes her down to avoid this fatal blow.\nOnce it's all over, a tiny body collapses in the great bamboo thicket, holding her wounds and letting out a long, slow breath.\nSunshine's rays filter through the leaves and shine on her face, the sound of fowlbeasts flapping by in her ears.\nBefore exhaustion brings her to sleep, her parents' lifelong teachings come back to her. The girl must offer her loyalty to the princess before her.",

          "description": "Coming in at a clip through the dense forest hills, her heart pounds like it wants to leap from her chest. The prey at her knees thrashes relentlessly and still draws ragged gasps, kiln-hot breath met with the ice-cold forest air as it flares from its nostrils, giving rise to a fine white mist.\nStooping low, she leans to its ear, and speaks a few soft words of comfort.\n'Shh, it'll be fine soon. Calm down, calm down.'\nHeeding her warm caress, the prey's struggles slowly cease, and it stares at her with its deep black gaze. In the pool of its stagnant eye, its pupil still tremors and quakes, stirring a whirlpool in its sclera, tenaciously seeking to draw one last drop of mercy from the two eyes staring back.\nYet her voice is a ruthless gust that coils through dead leaves.\n'It'll all be over soon.'\nWith a draw of a hunter's knife from her rear hip, slitting the prey's throat is both quick and clean. Fresh blood gushes from the incision and stains the earth, leaving behind a thick iron stench which mixes with the rotting autumn leaves and lingers for a good while in her nose.\nThis month shows signs of spring, winter having only just thawed, and the ice-littered creeks chill her fingers to a deep red swell while the blood hardened on the knife washes and melts away in the current. Like red threads needling through the water, flowing with the creek to the forest's edge.\nBehind her, a full beastskin hangs on a branch, with a bonfire lit below to cook the moisture from it. The prey's carcass has been split, one half skewered above the fire, wafting an enticing aroma of grease as it roasts. The other half she's left by the creek, soon to be found by scavenging animals following the scent of blood, and dragged away in their mouths.\nDaytime follows in the departing footsteps of night, early morn filtering through the forest in slanted beams from the east. Perfectly pale light glances again and again off the creek's shimmering waves, stabbing at her undefended eyes still adjusted to the earlier darkness. Her hand quickly shields them as she waits for them to adapt to the sun's sting. Warmth takes to the fine veins in her eyelids, inviting her to open her eyes again and see the beautiful sight. Letting out a deep sigh, she experimentally opens her tightly curled fingers. Her eyelashes tremble, she opens her eyes, and that which filters through the cracks between her fingers is the faint green of a rich forest. Deep in the trees, a kyebeast wanders through the cover, chewing leisurely at the grass, unaware that it's already been trapped in that frigid forest, and of the keen arrow nocked in a bow aimed at the hollow of its throat.",

          "description": "'Look at the girl in this photo. Memorize her appearance,' Danny Chip told Rustcage. 'If someone comes to your doorstep with a girl like this, look after her for me.'\nThe careworker at Lloyd Russet Biolaboratories often used to speak with pride, lips pried lightly by alcohol, of how their company had stolen rainforests and headwaters away from the aboriginals that survived on them. Of how amidst crop failure they'd bought the requisite Archosauria children for just twelve gold bonds and a handful of food. He would speak, too, of how those children priced at just twelve bonds would be remodeled into replicas of the 'Archosauria War-God.' At the end of the story, they would defeat their competitors, receive orders from the military, and then come home like kings...\nHalf a year later, the passionate egghead was reduced to a drunkard passing each night with a bottle, always grumbling in despair of the chaos of the experiments: an escaped fowl during Phase II of animal testing, the complete failures of Phases I and II of human testing, all the test subjects destroyed... then ultimately, Subject 75, the most abnormal individual in all the Phase IV human tests.\nSubject 75 was not just devoid of two horns; her personality lacked any resemblance to a weapon of war. Even after provoking her by all proven means, driving her to her last gasp, she showed no hint of the 'War-God' essence at all. Bizarrely, as a failed article, 75 was only a momentary frustration to the careworker. Very quickly, he ceased to drown himself in drink, and began to happily chat with her about daily life, about his wonderful future with Careworker Celina, about how they'd raise a girl that loved princess stories, and go on vacation to Siesta together... A failure, yet one that guided this lost soul back home.\nHowever, all the 'successful' Phase IV subjects suddenly and collectively went out of control during obedience training one day, leading to the deaths of several experiment personnel. As was standard procedure, they had to 'humanely' destroy the subjects of this phase. That evening, Danny came to Rustcage's saloon, and handed him the photograph of Subject 75.\nIn the end, neither Danny nor the girl ever visited that saloon again.\nThe lab later officially declared that Danny had, along with fellow careworker Celina, 'lost their lives together' in the incident.\nSix years later, the noisy saloon patrons have turned into wild hunters, exchanging the saloon's fine dining for the taste of fresh sport... What was once an establishment in the wake of the Great Expansion now exists in solidarity with the Oripathy-blighted and the Pioneers that same wake had cast out unto the dried-up earth. Not even the biolab was spared, resting marooned upon loose rock.\nAt this moment, Rustcage stares at the girl not far away, then looks down to compare the photograph in his hands. He doesn't know why she's grown two big horns, but there's no doubt they're one and the same.\nHe sees the hunt wild and unadulterated, sees the food chain built around her. He sees civilization's mark gradually fading, and the wilderness baring her original face—despite her heavy infection he knows he stands no chance.\nFinally, Rustcage sets down his hunter's crossbow. With the last of his strength, he delivers to her his hoard of oh so many years, these farewell gifts from the wilds.",

Current electronic computational devices are not able to handle the enormous amount of information contained within Originium. I need a more suitable computational carrier...' \n'Having a person do it?! This is certainly a bold line of thinking. I... have to give it some thought.' \n'The prototype decoding device using a human computational carrier has been manufactured. Now, I just need a test subject with a clear mind and quick reflexes, preferably with a good understanding of computers and data.' \n'Subject selection complete. Subject codename: Ptilopsis.' \n'There is nobody in Rhine Lab more suitable than she is. Though my supervisor advised me to keep the experiment a secret from her due to its risks, I still informed her of the various possibilities that might arise during this experiment. This is my line in the sand, as a citizen of Columbia, and as a person.' \n'She agreed! She agreed! I knew it, I just knew she'd agree! I knew she'd be the one!' \n'I've already taught her the key points and operating procedures of the preliminary phase. She's a quick learner, and tomorrow, the experiment will begin. I trust we will join hands to usher in Columbia's future.' \n'The experiment has been going very smoothly, and all the data has fallen within the control range. We'll keep following this pace, and soon enough... Just a little more... Wait, no, no, no! This shouldn't be happening! H-Hurry, unplug her––' \n'The failsafe mechanisms activated in time, but... she still sustained injuries... Her brain...' \n'And the Originium infection...' \n'(Short, intermittent sobbing sounds)' \n'The higher-ups have already sent for emergency dispatchers, but, but this...' \n'It's my fault... It's all my fault...' \n'Based on the information she received before, I made a chip that can be inserted inside the body. This chip should be able to replace a portion of her brain's functions.' \n'Several of the department heads seem quite fond of this suggestion. Hmph. I know what they're thinking.' \n'The implant procedure was successful, but she's unresponsive.' \n'She's awake! But her language functions... seem to have some problems.' \n'She told me, another voice appeared inside her head, one that did not belong to any of the languages she knew. It placed a huge burden on her psyche.' \n'Only the use of machine logic language could soothe the pain.' \n'She is the first person in Columbia to survive a chip transplant operation. This is a pioneering achievement.' \n'But the world through her eyes seems to have become something altogether different.' \n'I also implanted a chip into my own brain, and the wound still aches, but I want to know how the information inside the Originium has changed her.' \n'What exactly is that voice?' \n'I will reproduce the experiment.' \n––Rhine Lab, Recording of Project *UNKNOWN* Director during her lifetime",

          "description": "The dessert craze at the Rhodes Island cafeteria has gone on for close to a week now. These past few days, dinner hours have ended with numerous operators unwilling to leave, sitting at already cleared-out tables looking around in anticipation of that day's confections.\nAn operator who wishes to remain unnamed (and is not a Lateran) confesses to us: 'I didn't believe them at first, when they said off-menu desserts kept showing up in the canteen recently. Then last night, my very idea of desserts got completely upended.'\nWe only half-believed it ourselves when we squeezed into the dessert section and pulled out what looked like an extremely ordinary 'lemon' from amidst the cakes. Not normally eaten whole, we cut the fruit open and got the familiar lemony scent, and even saw its glistening juices flow out from the cut. However, once we tasted the tart-yet-sweet, faintly milk-flavored layers of cake that made up the 'pulp' inside, like the other operators we were blown away by the chef's ingenuity and maestro-level craft.\nWe attempted to interview the few operators that typically make their way in and out of the cafeteria kitchen, but all of them smiled and refused to answer our questions. In the end, with Operator Ceobe serving as an avenue for our breakthrough, we finally obtained enough leads to discover the maker... no, the artist of these desserts.\nWe found the operator in question at the Medical Department. She was busy at the time, and could not spare us an interview.\nAs Operator Honeyberry (who just so happened to be free) informed us, the chef has recently been busy assisting Medical with developing pharmaceuticals more appealing to children.\nA significant number of child patients are aboard Rhodes Island, and the question of how to improve their compliance in taking medication has always vexed our medics. Many children instinctively make a show of resistance when faced with liquid or tablet doses that they hate the taste of. The vast majority of Medic operators can imagine that the simple addition of sugar wouldn't rid a drug of its strange flavor.\nAs of now, though, Medical has developed several successful formulations with this operator's help. Making use of her precise grasp on flavor and color, she's not only been able to conceal the uniquely offputting taste of these drugs, but has taken full advantage of the opportunity, using these medical flavors as a base to create aromas that make your mouth water. Following strict safety tests, these preparations have been provided to the children to immediately fantastic results. According to the little patients, taking medicine on time has suddenly become something to look forward to.\n(Underneath this news article is written in small font: She didn't want us to publish this draft out of shyness, and used more desserts to bribe us to that end... I mean, we couldn't not listen to her!)",

She has a decision to make.\n'You, take the beltway with your men. I'll take my team and make it through the city.'\n'Yes, sir.'\n'If we lose contact with each other, we'll prioritize the mission first. Make sure you do that. Got it?!'\n'Yes, sir!'\n'Roll out!'\n......\n'Dobermann, what should we do now?'\nDobermann and her team, having joined up with the resistance, have been retreating, but they find themselves being chased by pursuing enemies.\nShe must find a way to get her men out alive.\n'We can go this way... then take the waterway to make it past them.'\n'I'll need a few of you to stay behind, though...'\n'I'll do it. This is no problem for me!'\n'But...'\n'If I don't, all of us will die here, no?'\n'Sorry...'\n'This ain't your fault. You've done all you can.'\n'My brothers and I will get ourselves ready.'\n'I'm leaving everyone else to you!'\n......\n'Instructor, what should we do?'\nRhodes Island Operator Dobermann is currently carrying out a mission. The images she sees through her binoculars are once again forcing her to make a decision.\n'I think it'll be better if we lead the squad away and flank them.'\n'No, we'll wait till it's night where we are, then we'll head in through the ruins and attack that way. Our forces would be too divided, and that could lead to accidents.'\n'Understood.'\n'I'll head on inside first. Take the others to the objective point as soon as it gets dark and wait for my orders.'\n'That puts you in danger!'\n'This is the best way, and it's what I chose to do.'\n'I want all of you to trust in me, just like I trust you. Got it?!'\n'Yes, Instructor! Please be careful!'\n'Hmph, you just do what you are supposed to.'\n......\nThat night, Team Dobermann successfully completed its mission.",

You hear it a lot.' \n'But when it comes to how many can actually live up to the talk... Hah, guess he's pretty impressive.' \n'Ugh... the two branches here have tangled together and are starting to wilt. Going to have to prune them' \n'When you prune them and let them bud again, the part that survives flourishes. Even plants are like that.' \n'Too bad he didn't know how to swing a sword at all. Nothing but brute strength.' \n'Even after I broke his blade, he still wanted to complete his revenge, literally tooth and nail.' \n'He left his life behind so that the living could pay the price.' \n'A somewhat interesting idea, but...'\n'You'll never become strong if you only see your life as an extension of the dead.' \n'When plants treat the offshoots that have been pruned and propagated as their own nutrition, they will flourish more vigorously, and perhaps even bloom more flowers.' \n'All life is like this.' \n'......' \n'This pot might not do too well in the greenhouse. Go take it to the balcony.' \n'Maybe it'll grow into something new.'",

She gave a slight bow with her other hand holding out a magnifying glass before her, and then she took the measure of the villa step by step. All said and done, she lifted her head before the few people now stuck in the place.\nShe seemed somewhat nervous. Everyone could tell as much.\nThe girl took a long, deep breath and straightened her back, attempting to mask her vaguely perceptible timidity and fluster in front of all the suspects. She gripped her pipe tight, and gradually her nerves calmed.\nHer head was quite disheveled, her upwards-springing hair tied into two bunches, with red-rimmed spectacles and shining blue eyes behind them that gave a glimmering and lively gaze at the suspects before her.\n\n'Ladies and gentlemen.'\nFrom her breast pocket, the girl produced a pocket watch of fine craftsmanship, clearly exquisitely cared for throughout its years—of which it had plenty—and after checking the current time, she introduced herself thus, in an altogether too spry voice: 'Good morning, everyone. On request, I'll be the detective in charge of solving this case—'\n\nA detective!\nA faint murmur perturbed the crowd. She said she was a detective! Victoria certainly had no shortage of private detectives such as her, who took on all manner of commissions their clients were wary of entrusting to the police. Indeed, it was no unfamiliar profession.\nAnd yet...\nThis self-professed detective girl seemed simply too young!\n\n'Everyone! Hear me out, please!'\nThe tender detective surreptitiously gripped the items in her hands, then raised her voice. 'This may be the first case I've taken on—but—I ask you all to be at ease! I do have the approval of my grandfather and grandmother! I am a qualified detective!'\nShe did seem truly quite proud of the fact that her elders gave her their recognition, as her face which seemed altogether hesitant at first now gleamed bright with confidence.\nIt immediately gave her far more credible airs.\n\n'Thus, I ask you all to cooperate with my work!' said the young detective, puffing her chest out. And then with a bellow, 'I am!—this case's!—detective!'",

Pain mixed with anger, an anger that took her to fantasyland, a friendly-looking old Caprinae putting her on a sickbed, her hand trying to reach out and hold something, searching through a ruin and a blaze-scorched black, and something that feels like feathers, but in an instant it's gone, and nobody ever pulls her out.\n'Little friend, you've caught fire again.\n'You know, raging and screaming won't lessen your pain, nor will it ever solve anything.'\nCan it. All you do is talk in my brain and make my head hurt. You don't know anything!\n'But I can feel those pinpricks in your arms.\n'I've been able to feel them treat you as a monster since long ago. Even you yourself believed it, once.'\nThat was all that stupid goat's fault! He turned me into this, he...!\n'You resent Silence. You know she knows your past, yet she won't let you flame-roast that 'stupid goat' yourself.'\nShe... Silence isn't wrong for that! What do you know? I'd never blame her—\n'But your emotions still boil with wrath.\n'Didn't you decide? That you could sneak away, now that no one here binds you to a table anymore? And once you find the old goat, you'll beat his face to a pulp, burn his whole laboratory down, and then—'\n...I'm not gonna do that. I don't need Silence to tell me not to, 'cause I know that would be wrong. It's not that I wanna... kill him.\n...I <i>don't</i> know! Still, he...! Why can't I?! I've got fire, I'll burn it all—\n'You're shaking. You're recalling the days that inflicted so much pain upon you...\n'So stop.'\nNo... once I can control this fatso for real, I'll get to protect everyone, and Silence won't be like this anymore, and she won't fight with Saria either!\nAnd Darya can...\n'...You're crying.'\n...Shut up!\n'It's not your fault, little friend.'\n...Then whose fault is it?\nWho am I supposed to blame? I'm not supposed to burn that stupid goat up, so who do I blame...?\nThe voice dies down. No one responds anymore, and even the headache flags somewhat.\n'I still don't know.\n'Maybe, someday, you'll be able to separate the rights from the wrongs. Your experiences will tell you how to decide your own standards. You'll want to abide by them. And then, you'll do the right thing.'\n...Urk—my head hurts, my...\n'Shaw hid your charcoal grill in a corner of the depot under the stairs. Mint has some books she'd like to share with you. Beeswax has a bottle of fragrant perfume, and if you visit her, she'll be all too willing to coat your horns.\n'You know how mighty they all are. You want to protect them. So too do they want to protect you.\n'So what about that big fat talking balloon? It still worries you.'\n...I'm scared.\n'Fear can't limit you, Ifrit.'\nThe pain brought about by that voice is fading far away. She looks across an expanse of white. Who is responding to her?\n......\n'Sleep, Ifrit. No longer can those flames burn in our dreamlands, you and I. We will find peace.'\nAnd slowly, slowly, the flames go out.\nThe gargantuan being that occupied her dreamscape begins to wane, its fires fading crystal clear. Atop sleeps the unconscious Ifrit, who feels pain no longer. The fire blends into her. The fire, she has accepted.",

          "description": "Ifrit has been plagued by nightmares of late.\nThere is still fire. Ifrit is familiar with its warmth. It is the warmth of memory.\nThat fatso is still there. She remembers arguing with it, a long time ago. It said that fire was a force of destruction, that it was born to consume all things. Ifrit seems to hear its voice again.\n'Shut up,' Ifrit says, but swallows the words that should have followed—\nI'm doing something else with the fire. You just do your job.\nIfrit can feel the heat, but it is no longer oppressive, no longer urging her to burn everything around her. It has been a long time since Ifrit last had a fight with the fire. Flames no longer spout from her fingertips and horns out of the blue. She still has those burning dreams, where flames devour charred buildings, but she knows it is just a dream. The flames in the dream cannot hurt her or others any more.\nIfrit would not allow it.\nThe nightmares do not come from within herself.\nIfrit watches as the flames embrace the glass, slowly turning it orange-red. They expand with the air, and the glass gradually forms the shape of body and limb. The fatso has some skills, Ifrit thinks, as a tiny Feline begins to take shape in the flames.\nRosmontis often told Ifrit about her own dreams, a lab in her ice-cold nightmares, filled with strange instruments, with a long corridor outside. She has dreamt of walls being cut open like potatoes, the ceiling and the floor torn to pieces, iron pipes crushed into a ball... She said she was not alone in the dream. The Doctor was there, Muelsyse was there, and Ifrit was there, too. She said that her friends were in danger, and she wanted to destroy the danger. She said those nightmares had no ending; perhaps she was meant to see someone or do something, but she always wakes up before she could do so.\nIfrit has heard Rhodes Island and Rhine Lab staff say that Rosmontis' cognition is being rebuilt. She is working hard to rebuild her memories, like how she worked hard to build a castle with sand that day on the beach. Those painful memories would become part of the castle, too.\nBut memory should not be cold. At least, when we touch our memories, we should feel the hand of our friend, and we should feel that it is warm. The warmth of memory should be the warmth of fire.\n'Just know this: Your friends are waiting for you at the end of the dream,' says Ifrit to Rosmontis.\nSince that day, a tiny glass Feline has sat by Rosmontis' bedside, and a warm flame has burned within her heart.",

The blueprint for the completed thing is her own design, down to the types and itty-bitty details of the parts, but the whole thing was entrusted to the mentor Astgenne trusted most.\nIt was meant for Astesia to personally give to Astgenne at their birthday party, but the silly girl hasn't celebrated her birthday at home in ages.\nSo she waits, for the right moment.\nAnd in the end, she gifts it to Astgenne as a farewell present, the day she sends her off to university. She knows Astgenne is bound to like it.\n\nElena likes it indeed, and would love to assemble it. But looking at this pile of fragments, each a piece of art, she's struck by the feeling that she shouldn't complete it on her own.\nShe needs to find some free time—and take up a little of her older sister's—when they can assemble it together.\n...Or so she intends. She makes a note to herself on her pad before diving headfirst into her endless university courses and projects.\nIt's always on her mind, always. Every time she meets her sister, Astgenne wants to yank her over to the dorms, so they can complete the gift she gave her together.\nBut she blinks, and deadline for her thesis, and the requisites for her defense, and the pressure of her projects all loom, sucking away all her spare time. Every time she thinks of it, the crush of reality suppresses her urge.\nSome desires are untempered by time, but life and work are more than capable of postponing the realization of a wish, indefinitely\n.......\nOwing to some circumstances, she's now been sent out by Rhine Lab and become a Rhodes Island Operator. Her Rhine Lab colleagues helped her pack everything, and she now stands in her brand new vacuum of a room, unpacking that minor mountain of personal belongings and experimental equipment, bit by bit.\nShe finds a box laden with dust, and those dolts back at the lab didn't even pack her a dusting cloth. With no better option, she sounds the bell on the dorm room next door, first to say hi to her new neighbor, and second to borrow a rag to wipe off the dust.\nThe door opens.\nAnd there's Astesia, who stuffs clean wet wipes and an all-purpose toolbox into her dumbstruck little sister's hands.\n......\nOne wonders if perhaps, after the sisters have finished sorting out the room, that's the sound of a clock we can hear.",

          "description": "■■ Day, ■■ Month\nI got this shield from him. Unusual form, extremely sharp, but feels good to hold.\nHannya, he says its name is. I don't know what scripture was on his mind when he named it, or who he was thinking of, or what mistake, but I like the name. Hannya. I'll take it with me. From here on, it's my partner.\n\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nBefore I left, Hannya's good old 'father' said he had something else to give me. I thought it'd be something important, but it was just a hunk of scrap metal.\nHe said any handle paired with Hannya, I'd need to polish myself. It's a strange ask, but if that's part of the craft, it's not like I can't do it. Hannya already has a front that terrifies people, and an edge sharp enough to chop through enemies, so me personally making an inside to match might be the proper way.\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nApparently, I've got to polish this to the point I can fight holding Hannya barehanded without chafing my hands, or feeling any sort of discomfort.\nAs in, I've just got to polish all the edges flat?\nAlright, looks like this is going to be a very long process.\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nI feel like I've been polishing for long enough, but it still chafes.\nIt looks smooth and flat already. Is this still not enough?\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nIt's been... some time since I left Higashi. Lungmen's a complex place. There's good parts, and bad parts. I've taught lessons to plenty who needed them, and run across plenty of interesting folk. I think I like it here.\nThere's no part of Hannya's handle for me to polish any further. After using it so long, even the curve's run flat. But it's still a metal block in the end, and no matter what, it won't reach the point where people can use it without any discomfort. It seems like it was all an impossible task from the beginning.\nI guess my craft isn't perfected enough. Even if I force myself to polish all the edges flat, it still can't hide itself. An iron chunk's an iron chunk, and it won't get any softer. Even if it looks smooth and slick, its nature won't change.\nAs of today, I think I've understood his intent a little.\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nI got this gift from my friends.\nMaybe it's bad of me to say this, but I definitely didn't expect those two ladies to put so much care into thinking up a suitable present for me. A latest-model soft-strap shield handle... it sure is something I've been in need of. I appreciate the consideration.\nYou know what they say about kind gestures from friends. Let's try using it tomorrow.",

          "description": "L.G.D. backup Ah Hsiang sucks in a deep, deep breath when the runaway lets the first crossbow bolt fly. He can scarcely believe his eyes.\n'No one told me anything about this!' he shrieked. 'Why the hell are they doing this in the city? That's not how this is supposed to work!'\n'It's the pursuit of wealth. Not uncommon.'\nThe towering Oni lady who responds leans behind a metal barrel, her posture somehow relaxed, but her hand never leaving her shield.\nThere's a momentary break in the commotion.\nHoshiguma takes a peek out. The other end is pitch black, and she knows danger hides in the dark.\nThe L.G.D.'s reinforcements are still out in the street, hemmed by a group of runaways who've broken the rules, their attack primed and imminent.\nThe situation is, in essence, a total crapshoot, and they can only wait for a chance to break the encirclement.\nAh Hsiang's face is grave. He was a street youth, no stranger to the downtown. He'd scraped through life for some years in every corner of the city, just a nameless nobody, but at least he had a talent for making it, or so he'd profess.\nNow he was an informant for the L.G.D., and at a glance much steadier on his feet. No need to lie—Hoshiguma was happy for that.\nIt's hard to tell who brought up the conversation up first.\n'How's everyone else been?'\n'Pretty good. Ah Sam's family found him a job. Daai Tau's running a bar now. I remember he was counting on you for the official stuff, Madame Oni.'\n'That's right. You? Haven't been back home all these years?'\n'No, too busy. Wouldn't work out.'\n'How's your family doing, then?'\n'Living on pensions. Not much, but they get by.'\n'That's good. Stable.'\n'You, Madame Oni?'\n'I'm cruising. If it's enough, it's enough for me.'\nAh Hsiang doesn't say any more. Neither does Hoshiguma.\nThe weather is gloomy, and it rained not long ago.\nFilthy, strangely-tinted water leaks out from the pile of trash bags next to them, trickling out near their feet and straight into a drain not far away.\nA rustling gradually abates. The calmer it gets, the more his nerves stretch.\nAt that moment, Ah Hsiang suddenly becomes talkative.\n'You afraid, Madame Oni?'\nHe asks, but he also keeps going. 'I only agreed to pitch in for the L.G.D. this time because you were here.'\n'There was that one time they said we could go out with knives to spook that shop guy for trying to snatch up business, and we'd get lai see for it. You still remember that, Madame Oni?'\nHoshiguma stares at the alley entrance, unnodding.\nShe remembers coming across those youngsters a few years ago. They were trash, dumped out onto the street, seen as scum unfit for society. They lived muddied lives, liable to drop dead for no reason, at any time.\nSo when Wei Yenwu invited her to join the L.G.D., Hoshiguma spent a whole night thinking, and then nodded to agree.\nShe believes there'll be change in Lungmen.\n'If you didn't stop me back then, I would've gone with them.'\nThe voice behind her trembles.\n'I heard, later, they actually killed someone, and they all got thrown in.\n'And there was the other time, those mafia guys from outside came giving us trouble, and in the end it was you who held them off too.'\nHis throat constricts, his teeth chatter, and his voice seems to falter somewhat.\n'I've been thinking. My family's toughing it a little, going on nothing but pension after all.\n'I bet you'd have an easy time charging out there if you wanted. If I wasn't here.\n'I took out insurance on myself, you know. I'm sorted.\n'So, Madame Oni, don't worry about me—'\n\nClank. \n\nA sudden brittle noise.\nLike some kind of signal, the L.G.D. Inspector rises like a sheer mountain, and breaks her silence with a roar of fury.\nAll hell breaks loose within that shortest of moments, set to the sound of trash being trampled, and piles of barrels being knocked over, and crossbows slicing the air, and—\nHefty crashes of metal.\nAn unblocked bolt pierces the Lungmen Guard Department Inspector's badge Hoshiguma has set on her chest, but it doesn't stop her shield sweeping through every foe as she stands in front of the one she's meant to protect, not one step forward, not one step back.\nHoshiguma once again lifts her shield, swallows a mouthful of blood back down, and coughs twice before finally saying something.\n'Not worrying about you'll be a little difficult.'\nShe wipes a bloodstain from the corner of her mouth, voice as though choking on water. 'Try something I <i>can</i> do instead—say, letting me apply for your bonus this operation. How's that?'",

A third fighter has crashed the sacred ring! And she's catching every hook the Twinzerker Beasts throw at her!\n'What? ...You're taking me in for questioning? You suspect our underground arena of concealing and reselling your drugs?\n'No, let me finish commentating this match first! This is freedom, passion, one against many, the weak against the strong! THIS IS THE TRUE FACE OF THE UNDERGROUND RING!'\nA few Rhodes Island operators haul the commentator off, parrying the bottles and worn boxing gloves lobbed by the rowdy spectators, before a group of fiendish thugs blocks their path. Not that the ops want to escalate this any further, but the ringside is in chaos by now.\nThey're about to put on Shura's mouthguards and personally get to know the rules of the underground arena, but the mince-no-words Ursine opts to leap down from the ring and stop them.\n'I'll deal with 'em! Underground fight rules are MY rules!'\nIn Shura's memory, this is where she grew up, right here on the shabby stage under the sickly lights, under the cheers and jeers as the ref sounded the bell. Here, she faced opponents far stronger than her, matches called to screw her over. Here, she faced all that she couldn't see through and couldn't take down, and it didn't take long for her to learn to grin and bear it. Go down? Get up again. Keep throwing your fists. Use all your strength. Show 'em how done dirty you feel, deep inside. Free the rebel in your blood.\nOnce Shura comes back to reality, her fellow ops are bracing her. They're already leaving the underground arena. Once again, she took on a million to one. Once again, she won enough time for her friends to get back what was theirs. She hears them discuss a celebratory dinner tonight, floating the idea of ordering her a tub of honey so deep she'll never finish chugging. Finally, the corners of her mouth pull up in a punch-drunk smile, tortured muscles screaming with delayed-onset but oh so true pain.\n'Shura... you're pretty freaking beat up. Maybe we get a medic to treat you first?'\n'Oof... eaargh, I'll shake it off!'\nThe moment she loosens her jaw, her mouthguards drop right out. With a massive start, the gang realizes she's already chewed the damn things to pieces.",

The weapon granted the king an aura of gravitas that permeated the land, and the king never had to wield it against any enemy throughout his entire life.\nHe once wished to demonstrate his loyalty to Signora Sicilia like the others, yet was rejected nonchalantly. It was then he came to understand how she ruled this country replete with violence, as well as the weariness and helplessness she hid.\nBut now, he had no idea what sort of fangs this strange young wolf should bear.\nAn exquisite rapier, because she would inherit her father's eccentricity and elusiveness?\nA deadly great-axe, because she could not ignore the call of the wild in her blood?\nNo, neither would suffice. The smith tossed the half-finished weapon into the furnace's flames.\nShe was cruel, elegant and elusive as her father, yet something altogether different.\n'It's still not ready? My dear father did say to wait until my coming-of-age ceremony, but our enemies wish to see it tonight.'\nThe swordsmith explained that he was trying to forge a blade worthy of her. But the more he racked his brain, the harder it became to imagine what such a weapon would actually look like.\n'How about these?'\nShe haphazardly picked up a pair of swords.\nOnce upon a time, he had hoped to create a weapon that would serve as a testament to his skill. This pair of swords had demanded too much of his ingenuity, becoming more and more complex in the process. They sufficed as a conduit for Arts, but had become terribly unwieldy in the process, unable to even be sheathed.\n'A failure, destined to never be completed?' The white wolf waved the blades around and bared a smile—'I think I like the sound of that.'\nThe smith pleaded that her unique soul deserved a weapon far more special.\n'I'm afraid you have the wrong idea, sir. What I came here for was a tool. These are sturdy, and more than suitable to kill with. I like the craftsmanship, and plan to keep using them. That's good enough for me.'\nThe despairing smith could do nothing but watch her leave.\nPerhaps, his finest work was something he had rejected as a failure.\nPerhaps, any soul that could be defined by a weapon was too empty to begin with.\nThat night, the renowned swordsmith announced his retirement, and Lappland of Famiglia Saluzzo wielded her iconic blades for the first time—\nFrom that day on, the people would call them 'The Young Fang.'",

Not far away, an empty tin can topples over. She takes a small step back, crouching for a while under the shadow. Only once she's sure her silhouette is alone again under the moonlight—does her step pick up once again, deft like a wisp of fog. She finds her way straight through a window empty of its glass.\nA puddle of water rests on the ground, which she avoids with great intent. Probably the recent shower of rain, that tonight's so especially bright. Not a good omen, in any case. In times gone by, no one would dare trespass into the Forest thick of fog, for there was Witch's domain. The greedy merchant had want of the Witch's powers, but pitch-black smoke would bind the neck of such a soul. Only lost children would have good fortune in the night... Most of the coven had come to suffer a different kind of curse already, but in the hazy night those inauspicious stones would happily be hidden from view.\nA great fire of yore took the original Witch Forest. Thereafter, one nomadic city to the next, these empty rooms have been little more than the cracks amidst neon and skyscraper's reflections... hardly fit for a safe domain.\nShe silently patrols her temporary lodgings, and finds the Hat out of a pile of miscellanies. A broad-brimmed one, cloth heavy-set in all its layers. Its inside is riddled with patchwork, every hand which sewed on those eclectic fabrics still there in her memories. Some were wizened, some young, all so soft without exception, so tender. She jumps into it, lets the sheets of fabric surround her body, as if she's returned to their embrace.\nAnother hand rests upon her head. She remembers this one, the youngest among them, and the last to still follow her. This girl's hand once carried the scent of clean grass and fresh paper, like the others, but in these times it was always sullied with rust, with blood.\n'We've been found again.' The young Witch picks her up and cradles her, and puts on another hat entirely. 'Take a guess. How long can we still run, I wonder, before the next time we're caught?'\nThe creature brushes against the Witch's cheek, reflecting not an inch of light.\nTogether, she and the girl leap into the dark of night, straight through the Forest. Such is the freedom they were meant to share.",

          "description": "Specter clutches the candle holder tight. She remembers it. But it should not be here.\nThe Medical Department operators visited her a moment ago. They pricked an ever-so-cautious drop of blood from her finger, then left her alone to recite prayer from her heart, liturgical meanings discerned by none. They tend to her body, attempt to heal her rended ego—they would not bestow her such a vile gift as this.\nShe touches the candlelight, but the fingertip feels no hint of warmth. A momentary lucidity and tranquility race ashore like foam. The edges of the waves wash over her throat cut wide open, and zealotry, scorched sun-dry in darkness, extinguishes its bellows. In the same moment, white flame climbs her wrist, sets her nun's habit alight, and leaps from her shoulder to sink into her sweeping hair.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. Laurentina stands before a statue. The Stygian sea encases a dome teeming with lights. The figure freed from raw stone lingers in her eyes, and its shadow chisels out an alcove. There, Laurentina lifts a machine to cut stone, a 'Little Handy' roving in circles beside her, swallowing up the fragments that pitter-patter against the floor.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. Rallying cries. Piercing whistles and sawblades all around as far as the eye can see, gristle and blood peeled from body, bones met together and fractured apart. The hunters born beneath domes are tearing apart the barriers of flesh now before them, their enemies falling to the seafloor as raindrops to the surface. A lance severs open a cavity; an incisive and clarion order; amidst ocean's currents Laurentina charges in. She hears singing.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. The statue behind the candle holder is virgin holy white, and when it weeps, it casts a shadow. She is sliced apart, to then be mended; sliced apart again, to then be mended again. Finally, they use Specter to slice apart Laurentina, and allow the seeds of dry land to root within her body. Thus, the sister kneels before the candle holder, grips her pendant tight, recites prayer from her heart, liturgical meanings discerned by none.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. The door to the treatment ward is pulled open. A familiar scent. A lithe yet firm echo of footsteps strikes down the candle holder, melting it into the lights of the corridor. Specter curls up, dreaming a peaceful dream so rare for her. In her dream, she burns atop the candle holder, as if she is its fourth flame.",

She's here, waiting. \n\nFootstep noises. \nThe sound of boots treading on leaves. \nThe lone wolf patiently waits, until the prey has moved to the other side of her vision. Then like an apparition, she flits behind them, a cold glint in her hand. \nIn the next instant, the lone wolf's figure fades back into the night. \n\nThe visitor warily watches around, inspects their pocket, feels what they should between their fingers. They relax with a sigh, continue on, but are oblivious that the chip in their pocket has already changed homes. \nEven the counterfeit they feel now will, in a few short minutes, slip from their pocket, to disappear into the eddy of the woods' falling leaves. \n\nAfter all other breaths vanish, the lone wolf's figure emerges from the pile of withered leaves. \nThe true prey, the chip, securely lies deep in her knapsack. \nMission complete, the lone wolf sets back on foot, but her mood is by no means restful. \nDisconnected from her mission already, she's enveloped by the scent of the deserted overgrowth, and remembers Siracusa's wilds. \n\nShe walks alone, the past on her mind. \nThe wilds were drenched in blood. Grandma taught her how to get out of them, then straight away threw her into their midst. \nShe got out. \nShe exhausted a whole life's worth of possibilities at once, soaked in blood from head to toe, and finally got out. \nGrandma was very pleased, but as she expected, Grandma was no more than that either. \n\nShe got out of the wilds, and came headfirst into the maze, life's maze, far vaster than the wilds ever were. \nThe maze had uncountably many ways through, and Grandma never taught her a single one. \nSo she didn't know life's meaning, and she didn't want to either. She had no desire in her to learn, or to give it any trial and error. She just wanted the simplest way out of this whole maze— \nWithout Kal'tsit, she would be gone by now. \n\nKal'tsit said if you don't know where you can go, then stopping where you are, giving thought to the way forward, isn't necessarily a bad idea; during that time, she would be given shelter. \nShe listens to what Kal'tsit says. \nFor now, she stopped at a crossroads called Rhodes Island, and got food, a place to stay, and a salary she doesn't know the use of. She even got a small fluffy ball, stuffed in her knapsack, that she can hold in her hand when there's no Lupo's tail to stroke, letting her feel fur brushing past her fingertips. \nBut how long is she going to stay here? \nKal'tsit didn't say. \nBut she's ultimately unable to adapt to this tremendous maze, and the wilds stopped needing her long ago. \nSo, is she going to leave? \nShe doesn't know. \n\nThe dagger she knows lies deep in her knapsack, letting out a minute hum, just like a whimper.",

It's amazingly blunt. No lenscraft to speak of at all. Anyone can see how forced she is. After the commercial's over, whether anyone will remember the hair treatment cream is unknown, but the tail will have been undeniably close to perfection, soft and yielding with a gorgeous luster. Even the arc in which it pointed up, idyllic.\n\nProvence hasn't been a model before; she's only a Catastrophe Messenger. There's something she often hears, at least along the lines of it: 'if you can't do your best, you can only do better next time.' 'Better' signals something to compare to, and that signals regret. No one dares say whether the info one gets scrambling across and monitoring the wilds is 100% exact, whether you can get word of a Catastrophe to the epicenter in time, whether you can relay it to everyone there. Regret is part and parcel with a Catastrophe Messenger's work, and 'do better next time' is how they comfort each other. So when Provence had managed to shelter the villagers she'd just brought back from the barrens, and turned back to see a village lost under the violent storm, a village with people still into it, and she wasn't in time to save them, she could only tell herself: 'Don't blame yourself, Provence, settlements are too scattered in the wild, there's not even a comms line, you're doing this on just your own two legs, this was bound to happen... you can only do better next time.'\nThe next day, while she was resupplying at a town, she saw an engineering team. They were firm-hired, helping the local government install a local communications system, and they'd mounted electronic screens at some of the crossroads, so they could... put ads on them. Commercials worshipping quality of life bombarding people, one after another, while villagers in the wilds never even receive any life-or-death Catastrophe alert. Provence sought out the one in charge of the firm, and requested the local system extend its coverage out to the belt of surrounding wilderness. Even just a single emergency comms circuit more would do.\n'Those mucks are starving every day, and you think they can afford a hair treatment? How is this going to do anything for us?'\n'Don't give me that baloney about passing on hope. That's for you Catastrophe Messengers to worry about.'\n'Isn't there any way?' Provence knew this wouldn't work. She was just hung up on how if that emergency line existed, if things could be... that little bit faster in future. Of course she couldn't do her best, but she could do better, and 'better' signals something to compare to, and that signals there's a possibility, so it was down to her to do everything she could.\n'Did you just say your product was for hair treatment?'\n'Maybe—we can work together on this.'",

          "description": "It was an eerily still night, all light in the mansion extinguished, only moonlight spilling through the window into the room.\nIn the dim and the dark, a precocious daughter was led to her mother's delivery bed.\nStill so young, yet her strict education had already begun, and a sword and scabbard conferred upon her. The father's daughter naturally inherits the ways in which he surpasses others, bloodlines ever able to record power and wisdom. So was the theory to which the Confessarii subscribed.\nThe daughter watched her mother intently. The white-haired Sarkaz woman shut her eyes and laid down upon her back. Her body rested in calm and grace, shadow cast upon the wall as if the very contours of love for her child.\nBelow her, an infant's silhouette was drawn out by the slanted moonlight, magnified, and finally thrown upon the wall as if some sort of monster. This newborn life was yet frail and impotent, but did not impulsively wail as the normal suckling would, instead silently opening its eyes that could not yet see. Then clouds masked the moonlight, and the mother's arms slid down past the bed.\nTogether with the light, the monster's silhouette did vanish from the wall.\nNow the daughter gazed, at this succession of life.\nIt was not her first time witnessing a life pass before her eyes. Her father had departed this coil not long prior, and now, another demise and nascence was playing out. The vanishing and parting, the swelling and birthing of life, every particular presented before the daughter, yet her Arts... the Arts of the Confessarii, would not stir at this, would not collect at her fingertips as expected.\nWhy?\nThe daughter was struck by confusion.\n'Life' was... the concept her father made occasional mention of, the subtle weapon held by the Confessarii, and the thing she was ever urged to gain comprehension of. But her father's death was an airy gossamer in her memories, of little thickness or weight; her mother's passing was all too abrupt, as if someone had with naked hands taken all vitality from her. Now, here in this dead of night, her brother had silently arrived.\nJust what was life?\nJust what was it she was feeling?\nDid the lives of those that populated the household—her mother and father that possessed the same silvery hair, herself who resembled her mother so, and this newborn brother who had yet to cry—did their lives resemble each other in any way?\n'Our lives, in the end, will become one with a higher form.' Such did the father tell the daughter before drawing his last breath.\nInstinctively, she had sensed it was no majestic metaphor.\nLife flowed in the veins of the family of the purest bloodline, and something returned to her side once again in this moment... Or perhaps, it had never left.",

          "description": "At the interval where evening crosses into night, more fall. These people flee for their lives from the battlefield, but sickness has captured them partway, with death shortly to follow.\nA dying boy has lost the strength to struggle. His mother kneels at his side, but all she can do is hold him close, like one would their newborn. Sensing how the body in her embrace holds warmth no longer, a noise rises from her throat. It is more a cry than a shout.\nSeeming to heed her voice, the boy's weak chest gives a light flutter. Then, another. The movements from the body's deepest parts grow distinct, as if what lifeforce has passed now returns again.\nPractically leaping to her feet, the mother clutches tight the hands of the strangers who arrived here before them at some point. At a glance, she recognizes the two as Sarkaz, but whether they are the gospels of life or the emissaries of death, she can do little but beg.\nThe white-robed Sarkaz places her hand to the chest of the ailing. The black-cowled, instead, lowers her gaze down at them. What remainders of sunlight still strain past night's shade sink now into the pallid eyes of the dying. Gaze meets gaze again, between he and his mother. From their start to their end, the memories which engrave each passage of a person's life, and the emotions held therein, seep out from their selves, circling them together with the faint light of the setting sun. It is a light of no warmth, and ceases now to flow... simply, its journey is from the eyes of the dead to the eyes of the living. A teardrop falls from the mother's dried face, whereupon this instant elapses, and night finally enshrouds one and all as equals.\nShining silently watches the last wisp of twilight pale into the night.\n'Legend holds that once, in ancient Kazdel, was a white-horned King of Sarkaz.' A cold voice from behind her. 'It's said they possessed the ability to weave sunlight. They made the evening their thread, and wove the Sarkaz's past, present, and future glory into the sky. Each soldier fighting upon the battlefield needed only to lift their head, and they would see eternity in a mirror. It led them to forget thoughts of life or death, and under the King of Sarkaz's command, they conquered all.'\n'Legends of the sort are plentiful in Kazdel,' comes the white-horned physician's response.\n'Placing the living in touch with the boundary between life and death both spurs their courage to rush into death, and leads them to perceive life as something not devoid of meaning. Thus, they bid a better farewell to their loved ones,' Kal'tsit recounts factually. 'Through your and Nightingale's treatment, the patient's final Oripathy flare-up has been suppressed in his terminal hours. The rapid growth of Originium crystals in his body has temporarily been pacified. You have not only aided him in his peaceful passing, but saved his mother too.'\n'Hence why you haven't given the assassin staring at me a single opportunity.'\n'When we first met yesterday, I noticed the look in your eyes as you saw Amiya. You knew who she was from the first moment, and had no intention of imparting your secrets to us, yet you did not hide that flicker of emotion.'\n'What emotion?'\n'Compassion.' Kal'tsit closely watches over Shining's eyes. 'Identical to what you showed here and now. It is a physician's gaze.'",

          "description": "A bonfire crackles quietly. A young knight walks nearby, the light of the fire glinting dully off her armor, gone without maintenance for far too long. The coat of arms on her chest is completely scratched off, but the medic, who's trudged across more lands than most, can tell it is of Kazimierzian make.\n'Is your companion resting?' asks the knight softly, her voice filled with apology. 'It truly weighs on me that she should be so frail, yet use her Arts to rescue me. I hoped to be of service to you in some way, which is why I came back.'\n'Please, sit,' answers the medic.\n'No, allow me to be your sentry,' says the knight.\nHer hands grip her warhammer as she stands calm yet firm at five paces out. Her armor is speckled with blood, too; mere hours ago in these twilight wastes, she fought tooth and nail against mercenaries plundering a caravan, the radiance of her Arts nearly enough to convince one that the sun had risen anew. Now, those golden rays merely float about her weapon and body, indistinct. She professes herself to be Infected, afraid of neither the mercenaries' Oripathy, nor of giving her own life.\n'Do you still believe we shouldn't dissuade you?' asks the medic. 'Even though you know full well that despite felling a team of hired soldiers, the mercenary powers camped nearby will continue plundering wherever they please.'\nA lengthy silence. The knight turns her head. The slow rise and fall of the pale-white Sarkaz's chest as she holds her staff, her frail limbs pierced by fine and pointed Originium crystals.\n'I'm sorry, I simply... Perhaps I'm still not used to this.' Finally, she lowers her gaze. 'An insurmountable foe, incurably terminal... It wasn't you I was angry at, back then.'\nHer helpless indignation burns silently in the dark of night. The medic recognizes the naivety in those eyes, those familiar flames not knowing where to burn, that were inevitably snuffed out, one after another, in the misery of the battlefield.\n'I believe that... your willingness to act in defense of others, has sufficed.' She prods the bonfire with a branch, and speaks again with a nod to the knight. 'Please, come and sit. You won't wake up Liz.'",

Cut up big pieces of food with your knife like this, stick your fork in, and you can put it in your mouth and eat it. You all got that?'\nIt's the young Zalaks' first time at the dinner table, learning how to use the tableware, and Hamelin is among them. She's never seen such sumptuous dishes before, their glistening sheen like flowing gold.\n'Hamelin, when I grow up, I'm gonna make sure we eat really tasty food like this every day!'\nHearing the voice beside her perk up, she turns to look and is met with her sweetheart's smile.\nMuch, much later, when she's long since left her tribe, left her beloved, Hamelin skulks alone in the dark. It's been so long she hasn't the energy left to recall the scene. Even filling her stomach is too much to ask now.\nAnother mission nobody else was willing to take. Her failing to contact her target the first time has lost her all her equipment, the only thing saving her life being the ditch she hid in. The aftermath of this mission failure will be hard to shoulder, but she's void of fighting capacity anyhow. Hamelin presses forward, limping against the damp brick wall, eyes sweeping over the putrid filth, searching for anything she can make use of. Eventually, in the thick of the mud, she catches sight of a portable dining set that's been thrown away.\nShe picks it up, wipes it off, hangs it on her waist, and then climbs out of the sewer, finding the restaurant where her target sits.\nIn the process of taking out her target, every item in the set finds its use: the bowl, the spoon, the fork, the knife, the canteen... In a first for her, she's done an efficient job, undetected by anyone. Hamelin exits the lavish, high-end restaurant, and wanders alone onto the streets. She feels famished, completely out of strength. Winding down, she slowly slumps against a wall, pulls in her knees, and buries her head deep.\n'Hello? You hungry? Want something to eat?'\nHamelin raises her head to find a large-tailed Lupo girl. The girl leads Hamelin back to her office, and places before her the remainders of her food supplies.\n'It's all we've got. Put something inside you, okay?'\nWatching Hamelin's movements, her brows suddenly knit.\n'Hey, don't use your hands—you're carrying tableware, aren't you? Are you not that good with it? Let me teach you.\n'Put your food in the bowl, then use that spoon to scoop up a mouthful. You can cut up big chunks of food with a knife, and stick it on your fork to eat it. Hand me your canteen—I'll fill you up some water.\n'If you go hungry again, you're free to stop by every day for something to eat... huh? What's wrong?'\nHamelin stares up, blinking frantically, refusing to let the tears fall from the corners of her eyes.",

          "description": "Aww, naps are so comfy and warm, and when I wake up I can go see the baseball game... Cuora blissfully turns over on the deck.\n\nHuh, where am I? Why's the sun a baseball, and why are all the clouds mitts? ...Before her sprawls the baseball field she knows so well, where she once swung her bat to her heart's content. Hmm? Someone's crying outside the field, and they've got crystals growing all over their chest, and their baseball got broke in half and they dropped it next to them.\nHello, why are you crying? Oh, I think I know you from somewhere? You're that ball player Ambrois Edwards, right? Look, I wrote your signature on my bat! But I guess I misspelled it as Edgards, heheh!\n...But he pays no attention to her, and continues to weep. The people on the field shoo them out, shouts of anger becoming baseballs pelted at them, striking against the Originium crystals on the player's body. He covers himself tightly with clothing, and gradually becomes a giant, solid, silent stone, losing all light.\nCuora puts her backpack on him, and tells the player she'll take him to Rhodes Island, where they'll be sure to turn him back to normal.\nThey climb over a hill of helmets stacked high, cross a bridge made of bats, ride a baseball through the sky—\nOnce the figure of the landship reveals itself before them, Cuora gleefully shouts, look! We're here! You can get treated here, and you won't need to be scared of getting chased off the field, and you won't have to use clothes to hide the rocks, and then they'll keep cheering your name in all cities everywhere—you're Ambrois the Invincible!\n...The player seems just as happy, and he emerges from the crumbling stone, and reaches an arm out, and waves a bat—\n\nPhew... hey! Who hit my head?!\nLava, lemme tell you about this really long dream I had! It was about... um, what was it about?\nWho cares! C'mon, the ball game's about to begin! And Mister Ambrois finally came out of retirement for this one!\n\n...In the Infected neighborhood, a few railings hem an empty lot, which the people have taken to calling a baseball field.\nCuora sees her idol. The freshly unretired player isn't hiding the crystals on his body, and the cheers drown out all other noise. She jumps and leaps in excitement.\nAbruptly, out on the field, Ambrois waves a hand at her, and steps out of the crowd to give her a light pat on the shoulders. Here in the sun, Cuora sees a smiling face.\nAt this moment, she recalls that kind of a long time ago, she was driven off the baseball field for her own Oripathy. That day, she wandered the streets from end to end, and ran across a weeping ball player.\nShe can't quite remember who it was. She can't quite remember what she said, either.\nBut the player before her right now says this to her: 'Thanks for those words of comfort you gave me, li'l missy.'",

THANK YOU.\nCONTACT: Myrtle\n(A handwritten addendum follows.)\nDurin says this doesn't actually tell anyone what I lost, so I should add some details about the treasure.\nDESCRIPTION: Tiny, thin card, my name written on it, usually kept in a beautiful card holder. Best thing I ever got on the surface.\n(Handwriting changes color at this point.)\nHow can no one have seen my treasure or my vault? Impossible! But Durin says I have to write about it.\nEvery child of First Avenue keeps a vault where they stow their valuables away. For example, a door bolt you can use as a gun. (The evil neighbors on the commercial street started copying that, the scoundrels.) As Generalissimo of First Avenue and Third Commercial, my collection was naturally the richest, enough to move anyone who saw it, not to mention the fine collection from the surface...\nDurin stole my pen just now. Said I write too much about nothing and to get to the point. Who cares about her! Why isn't she asleep yet?\nEXAMPLE FROM COLLECTION: Tablecloth that never ever gets dirty (my first treasure). Apparently made of materials my dad invented. Paint and draw all you want and it stays clean. Mysterious! I had to listen to my dad go on forever before I understood how it worked. It looks a lot like a flag, so I decided I would campaign everywhere with it. People back home teased me about it, but it stands witness to my great journey as Generalissimo. I didn't think twice before taking it with me to the surface.\nMy lost treasure is about on par with that tablecloth.\n(Newer handwriting follows, ink still wet.)\nIt's not about the apple! Yes, the apple is a treasure too, but I didn't lose it, I loaned it to Engineering!\nADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENT! The missing treasure was the first thing I obtained when I came aboard, and the operators said it marked me as a member of Rhodes Island. I didn't put any stock in it at first, but came to find that that's just how great Rhodes is: there are new things all over, the operators are wonderful and listen to what I have to say and trust my talent as a generalissimo, and I can be of help to everyone too. And most importantly, nobody laughs at my flag, and the Doctor loves it!\nI'm very happy at Rhodes Island, and that thing has become important to me, and now a treasure.\nI hope that finally clear things up.\n......\n'Myrtle, would that treasure you lost happen to be your... work ID?'\n'That does ring a bell or three... oooohhh, I remember! Yes, that's it!'\n'Um... isn't it right there on your chest, then?'\n'Huh?!'",

          "description": "Something's definitely new about the Slobberknocker's sign.\nBack in the gym in the lockdown zone, Morgan's first order of business is to check the sign hung over the entrance, with Vina's blessing. The shoddy paint has bubbles trapped in it, and the big 'Slobberknocker' that's been carved is definitely a cleaner job than when Hannah first had a go.\nInside the big lockbox under Morgan's bed rest her dearly beloved Morgan's Memoirs, still safe and sound. After triple-checking it hasn't been touched at any point, she pulls out the good tipple stashed alongside, takes two honking swigs, then chokes and starts hacking and coughing.\nPast its best-by date, but still. If it was a good tipple, it's always worth a try.\nNow fretful, Morgan looks through the pile of old cruft in her box. Something's missing.\nBut it turns out to be a page that's fallen out of her Memoirs, and just a quick skim is enough for her to remember all the details.\nThis was back when their old neighborhood friends weren't taking the Glasgow Gang's biz seriously yet. No denying that Morgan's ideas then were absolute rotters from time to time, stuff like getting outsiders to buff up the gang's standing. Who knew she and the one-track mind Hannah would hit it off so easily? And so they went about harassing plenty of youths from Victoria's other parts.\nUntil Hannah was humiliated at the hands of she who protected those youths, Vina.\nThat was the first time Morgan heard Vina's name, more than a decade ago. Hannah just kept pestering Morgan to talk this 'outsider' Feline into joining the gang. Went as far as talking about 'protecting the neighborhood toy factory' and stuff like that as a front. Shame the Feline in question wouldn't fall for that.\nWhat narked Hannah more was when some noble's servant from the city center came to mess with the toy factory for whatever reason, both she and Morgan tried to stick their heads out for the neighborhood and took a horrid beating instead. And then in the end, who but Vina would show up and shoo the two out of there.\nHannah came back and spent that entire afternoon in a huff. After making a big show to Vina that blew up in their faces, she'd never agree to join now. But to the surprise of both, that night a Vina covered in wounds ran up to the gym cradling a huge box of local specialty toys, banging away on the door.\n'From the toy factory's owner. This way everyone'll know the factory is under Glasgow Gang protection.'\nMorgan made fun of Hannah about it for ages afterwards. The dumbstruck Hannah and the visibly impassioned Vina would become the principal heroes of the Memoirs in time.\nAnd it's ever since then that Morgan's decided deep down to protect Vina. After all, everyone knows the poncey lords doomed themselves by messing with Central.\nIt's there that Vina, wearing a perplexed face and holding a rusted toy, interrupts Morgan's reminiscence.\n'I found this in my room. Do you remember whose it is?'\nMorgan finally twigs what was missing from the box. Up in high spirits, she slings her arm over Vina's shoulders.\n'Let's go ask Hannah. She might know.'\nAt least nobody's changed.",

Indra could barely keep herself conscious, but she used all her will to keep herself together and face the enemy head-on. Here, at the decisive moment, all she ought to need was one more jab.\n'You still want to go?' The calm voice of the opposing party was nearly drowned out by the sound of her own heavy gasps for air.\nLoose silver hairs drooped down across her forehead, blocking her vision and blurring out the golden figure standing firm before her, illuminated by a streetlamp. 'Don't be so quick to call yourself the winner, you little shite! I ain't lost yet!' Indra adjusts her breathing and secretly shifts her center of gravity to behind her left hip, all while gathering her hair firmly behind her shoulders. She raises her fists and clenches her fingers, gripping her shabby brass knuckles even tighter than ever before.\n'I'll help you remember, outsider. This here street's mine—Indra of the Glasgow Gang!' As soon as the words were out of her mouth, the silver figure suddenly steps forward, pouncing upon her opponent faster than the eye could see. She lifts her left fist as if putting every last ounce of strength into this one strike, but then commands her body to turn and instead funnel all that strength into her right fist.\nIndra hears the golden-haired girl mutter in her ear: 'I'll remember alright, Indra of the Glasgow Gang.' A tranquil voice, as she always was. Indra still remembers that after, she lost her balance, she fully expected the cold embrace of the cement road, but that hard sensation looming large in her imagination never came. Through closed eyes, it was like she had... fallen onto a ball of sunshine.\n'Run? Run from what? Sorry Vina, I was daydreaming a bit, didn't hear ya.'\n'How to Fight with the Glasgow Gang. This was your work, wasn't it? Rule Number Four, and this is the most important rule: When it comes time to run, remember to run.'\n'Ah, yeah! Pretty much sums up every street fight I've gotten into over the years.'\n'That night we first met, why didn't you run?'\n'Gonna have to have a think on that one.' Indra lowers her head and contemplates for a moment. 'Back then, whenever we ran from a fight, it was so we could survive. For scroungers on the street, nothing's more important'n staying alive. But...'\n'But?' Siege sits up, facing herself towards Indra.\nIndra raises her head, looking right back at Siege. Under the flickering lights of the boxing gym, two pairs of golden eyes face each other, and she sees herself reflected in the Aslan's eyes.\n'But there's no Feline who doesn't like some time under the sun, right?' Indra draws back the corners of her mouth, impishly baring an ivory grin.",

          "description": "This round shield sent from Rhodes Island's Engineering Department seems rather plain, but robust and reliable. Apparently it was the result of the Department holding a 'traditional Victorian arms manufacturing competition' in their spare time. 'This was one of the symbols of a knight,' said the Engineering operator to Dagda in their most charming voice, 'so we decided it'd be best to give it to one of the lady knights making the rounds between Rhodes Island and Victoria.' Dagda looks at the shield proudly displayed atop the table, and can't help but think back to the time before she was accepted as a trainee under the Knights of the Tower.\nBack then, other than the strict physical and tactical training regimens, she also took many classes on knightly etiquette. Amongst the grueling and complicated tests of memory and body language drills, this simple round shield had been a major component of them. The historical piece of military equipment was once used daily by knights of old, but the knights of today have long since left theirs at home when marching to war. They would be hung above fireplaces, or used as a nameplate to display one's identity. Expensive paints were commonly used to draw family crests or the coats of arms of various knightly orders. These brightly-colored designs would cover up the shield's own color, just as their delicate etiquette would cover up the inherent violence a knight represents.\nFinn, the Captain of the Watch, once described a scene of the knights and their dazzling shields to Dagda: During the evenings of celebration days, the knights would parade down the street, clad in fine armor and with arms in hand. Their shields with their crests and blazons would proudly display images of their birthplaces, or warriors in various stances, or myriad different flowers, or great sturdy beasts, or checkered patterns one could weave into a net. The crisp rhythm of the military drums accompanied deep horns enveloping the orderly knights, and by the end of the parade they would all face towards the flame atop the tower. But that tower has long since collapsed, and these knightly tableaus now exist only in Dagda's imagination.\n'I've never actually seen the scene my mentor once described to me.' Recovering her senses somewhat, Dagda continues. 'Just like those books that record the exploits of knights long past, and the ones attempting to define whether a knight's life was glorious and honorable, my position as a knight is long gone. If you asked me if there's still anything worth engraving on that...' Dagda takes the shield off to the workshop, where she draws what she considers to be her emblem—a coat of arms from the streets.",

I've waited a whole year, and I've gotten really good with my crossbow! I can hit a tree branch from 200 meters away!' \n'Fine then, if you can go outside town, slay a gloompincer, and bring it back to camp before nightfall, I'll let you join.' \nThe squad captain couldn't talk the young girl out of it, so he wanted to make things as hard for her as possible so that she would reconsider. \nThough he had said those words half-jokingly, how could he possibly leave a child to fight against a gloompincer alone? He followed the girl quietly, curious as to what she planned to do. But when he saw her scouting out a sniping position, camouflaging into the environment, and then landing three clean shots in a row, he changed his mind. \nThe captain appeared in front of the girl as she dragged the corpse of the gloompincer back to town, the slain beast almost bigger than herself. \n'Come with me from now on.' \nThe girl lifted her head with a smile across her muddied face. \n\n'The Knight's Forest,' page 53. \nTime flies, and so the young girl grew up. She had fought in many battles against the Ursus Army, scoring success after success. The knights would come and go like the wind, routing the Ursus troops before disappearing without a trace. As their names spread fear through the ranks of the Ursus Army, the knights' prestige soared ever higher, and the girl herself became a war hero in the eyes of the people. \n'We won again. Why are you frowning?' The girl asked the captain. \n'Winter is almost here, and our supplies are running short. How long can we persist like this?' \n\n'The Knights' Forest,' page 137. \nThe fated day finally came. \nWhen the enemy army invaded, the knights prepared to sweep them with their usual hit-and-run tactics. But at that moment, the might of Ursus's artillery fell directly on top of them, and the knights were completely unable to put up a fight in the face of overwhelming military strength...... \n'Impossible! How could Ursus possibly know our precise location? It's utterly impossible, unless––' \nThe girl didn't have time for idle thoughts. The most important thing was to break free from the enemy's siege. If she died here, everything would've been for naught. \n'One day, I'll find you, whoever you are––' \nAgainst insurmountable odds, the girl somehow managed to escape the hail of bullets. Behind her... came the smoke of her hometown ablaze. \n\n'The Knights' Forest,' page 201. \nAll the pages of the book after this point were burnt, the edges of the leaf caught between the pages singed. \n\nThe leaf was laminated and stowed in the girls' tactical equipment box. Every time she put away her equipment, she would take another look at that leaf. \nThis may be the last leaf from her hometown that she can still see. \nThis is the story of an ancient war. Just another story. \nBut to Firewatch, this book – and the sole leaf remaining – seems to hold some deeper significance.",

It's totally gaudy.'\n'Conviction is an extremely sacred existence, with extremely serious rituals. Naturally, the cooler the better. Don't concern yourself with unimportant things. I've recently discovered that the traditional trolley problem isn't difficult enough to challenge the geeky fellas these days, so I'm working on an upgraded, super-difficult version. I ask of you...' \n'Ahahaha, I suddenly remembered I have something to do. Let's talk more later.' \n'Fortune teller, your divination exists at the intersection of mysticism, logic, and art, just as Conviction's prior trial. I ask of you...' \n'Divination is much more practical than simply confusing people with riddles.' \n'Oh, Singer, I ask of you...' \n'......' \n'An upgraded version of the trolley problem: the surgery problem! Take this doctor next to me as an example. One day, this skilled and compassionate doctor treats six patients. They are dying and each needs different organs to be transplanted soon in order to survive, but the hospital doesn't have any of the organs in stock. While the doctor is performing a routine checkup on another patient, the doctor discovers that the patient's organs would not be rejected by the six dying patients. In fact, they would be a perfect fit. Additionally, this patient is only passing through for a checkup, and even if this patient disappeared, it would not provoke any suspicion. Now then, how should the doctor proceed? \n\nThe trolley problem is not about the answer that the respondent gives in the end, but rather about the conflict between nature and humanity experienced in the formulation of that answer. Whether the respondent hesitates, calculates, finds the situation unbearable, weighs emotions over righteousness or vice versa, all of these struggles are reflected on the outside, through micro-expressions, through one's eyes and very demeanor... \nYou really have no sense of artistry... Conviction, Conviction of course is an art. To stand trial before Conviction is an art. Every aspect of the Conviction Fist is also an art. People who have passed Conviction's test transcend and move to a higher realm. This, too, is art! Ah, whatever, it's impossible to explain these things to you people.'\n'But, you just scared that doctor away!'",

At the break of dawn, Vulcan takes her tongs in hand to pluck out a half-molten glowing red lump of iron from the forge, placing it atop the Shaper and suddenly remembering what a priest from Lachedamon once told her. 'It is destruction, a destruction that cannot be avoided.'\nShe gently flicks her wrist, then begins to beat the iron with her hammer. When Vulcan still lived in Minos, she would use any spare time she had to visit the hall where the memories of heroes of generations past were honored. There, she and her friends whiled away their time. She would say very little, preferring to listen attentively to the various sermons and debates of others.\n'As for why man pursues eternity, we strike the earth with enough fervor as to seem mad, hoping to reveal some scant ruins with a handful of phrases carved upon them, only to proceed to worship them as fragments of some eternity itself. Even were we merely to confirm that the concept of 'eternity' even exists, that alone would be comfort enough to those of us fated to die one day.'\nVulcan thinks back to the candles that stood before the statues in the hall back then. Those offered by the pilgrims in praise of their ancestors burned silently, somewhat resembling the very same people there to pray, awed and quieted by the words of the priests. Afterwards, the more their flames grew weaker, the more they danced madly out of control, much like the thoughts of those silent pilgrims. Once more she uses her tongs to pick up the iron that has just begun to take shape, and plunges it into the water. It hisses and sputters in surprise, before quieting down just as quickly. Once more she places the iron into the furnace, treating it the same way she did before, over and over again.\nVulcan truly understands the Minoans' obsession with these grandiose sentiments, for Minos was far too ancient, and yet Minos was far too young. Its history stretched back towards infinity, yet it had nearly died. Though she is not particularly interested in either the worship of eternity nor dreaded mortality, to take it a step further, she believes this to be a common point between the cultures of Sargon and Minos, one bred in both their hearts. An irrelevant, elusive dream. \nShe places the finished work upon her anvil. This unremarkable iron ingot was the daily task of Minoan blacksmiths, passed down from generation to generation. One day in the future, it will find itself in a different shape, or perhaps reforged into the already-broken spine of some equipment. She powers down the furnace, and takes out some honey biscuits she had baked at the same time. I care only for the present, she tells herself.",

Are the flowers and fragrances here able to calm you down?\nYes...\nIs 'Nightmare' causing your panic?\nI don't know.\nGloria, for this consultation, I'd like to chat with you. I'll need you to try not to let 'Nightmare' come out. Can you do that?\nI... I can try.\nGood, I trust in you. If she's about to come out, you warn me as loudly as you can, okay?\nMm. Let's begin. Last consultation, you said you were awake while 'Nightmare' came out. What did it feel like, during that time?\nIt felt like... like I was sitting in front of a big screen. The sounds, and pictures... were all really clear, but I wasn't able to do anything.\nYou did something to take back control of your body. Can you describe that?\nI ran and ran, and there were all these threads pulling at me, sticky, and dark, and I was pulling those threads... [COUGH], [COUGH]!\nGloria, are you alright? You have a very bad cough there.\nCould I have a cup of water, doctor?\nHere.\nThank you.\nLet's continue. Were you doing that because you don't like 'Nightmare' occupying your body? So you'd like to get rid of her?\nNo, I just feel... helpless. Like if I don't do this, I'll lose something.\nWhat do you think of 'Nightmare'?\nShe's different from me. She does things I can't do. It scares me a little.\nDo you consider the two of you independent from each other?\nProbably.\nSuppose, and this is only me supposing, that one day, out of the two of you, only you were left. How would you feel?\nI don't know... [COUGH] Sorry, I need more water.\nRelax, it's okay. Now, we're going to try a slightly different method for our chat.\nI'm going to have you recall some quite deep memories. Don't worry, I promise it can't hurt you in any way.\nMm. Watch my three fingers carefully. One by one, I'll bend them down, and they'll sink slowly into the deepest parts of your mind.\nThree.\nTwo.\nOne.\nAre you Gloria?\nYes.\nGloria, can you recall when 'Nightmare' first emerged?\nI don't remember exactly when, just... that night, I had a bad dream.\nA bad dream?\nMm, I dreamed there was a white wall, with very bright corridor lights, and lots of people, and a lot of blood... and then, she appeared.\nSo she first appeared in your dream?\nYes.\nWas she doing anything?\nI remember, I dreamed she... saved me.\nShe saved you? And did she do anything else?\nAh... [COUGH]! Water, I need...\nCalm down, take me through slowly.\nHere—agh! That's my hand!\nHeh. Heheh.\n'Nightmare'! But why wasn't there any sign?\nOh, Gloria clearly warned you, you just didn't notice. What did you think? My imitation of her's quite a good one, isn't it?\nRequesting backup! 'Nightmare'—\nHush, not loud. Now, do you think that really was a bad dream? And just which of us could be after the Originium?\nThe twinflower, the doublet... truth and lie. How are you supposed to tell them apart?\nAlright, now listen to me. Hand over the Originium...\n—RECORDING ENDS HERE.",

Rewrite it.'\nThe elderly Savra watches from across the desk as the Mountbelan heiress crumples the scorched paper and furiously tosses it into the rubbish bin.\n'The Infected who call...'\n'Five students were injured in the attack. Furthermore... No! This is pissing me off!'\n'All that these 'Reunion' scoundrels are doing is getting revenge on society and making everyone even more afraid of the Infected! Professor, there is no way I can forgive them.'\nHer professor does not answer her directly. After a brief moment of silence, he picks up the pen that was tossed toward him and sets it down next to Ethelflaed.\n'Try it again.'\n\n'Article 5 of the 'Infected Regulation Act...' The Infected's area of activity shall be limited to... This is what they came up with after all those meetings? Haven't they learned their lesson from 'Reunion'—Oh, I'm very sorry, Professor. And I managed to control myself so well.'\nEthelflaed lets go of the sheet of paper in a fluster. The meeting's document is once again scorched.\n'...It's really these documents' fault for being so foolish, though. Look at the ruckus the Infected are causing. How could those boneheaded lords still be cozying up to each other?'\n'Professor, I'll write them all a letter of complaint.'\n'They have to take the 'Reunion' problem more seriously and deal with it in the most effective manner. They must immediately—'\n'Uhh... It's burning again.'\n'Right. Try it one more time.'\n\n'Finally, exiled Infected are extraordinarily likely to bear a grudge and seek opportunities for revenge against the city... Phew, I'm done, Professor. I'm not particularly fond of this justification, but they don't leave me much choice. We have to put it in terms that those stubborn, short-sighted blockheads can understand.'\nEthelflaed wrote fifteen whole pages with the neatest handwriting and not the slightest scorch mark. She looks excitedly toward her professor.\n'Good.' Angst nods and takes out a letter he had written. It is addressed to a 'Rhodes Island', a name she is unfamiliar with.\n'You know the theory. You have mastered the techniques. Your studies can finally begin.'\n'You want to solve both the Infected's problems and the 'Reunion' problem... In that case, you should meet those who are truly fighting those problems head on.'",

All procedures and processes are completely transparent, and no part of them is in any way deceptive.\nWe keep strict confidentiality on patient information, and our independently founded blood bank has not, to this day, lost a single blood sample. Yes, not once.\nRhodes Island has confidence that we keep these samples safe under comprehensive surveillance, and it is only during treatment of disease that... what? Who's the supervisor of the bank?\nAhem. That would be Dr. Warfarin, one of Rhodes Island's most longstanding members.\nNo one could ever steal blood samples from under a Vampire's nose. I believe that it is precisely because Dr. Warfarin serves as its supervisor that we can confidently conclude that Rhodes Island's blood bank is not under any external threat.\n[Extract from Warfarin's diary]\nBlood tests on the new operators finished today. Haven't we had a few too many new ops lately? Feline, Perro, Liberi, Sarkaz... one lone doctor drawing all these vials from all these people... At first I was stirring a little at the scent, but by the end I was almost sick of the sight of it.\nKal'tsit really needs to laud me for my paranormal self-control. Forget all the young breeds running amok out there these days... Not even the old guard of our race could match my endurance.\n...Forget that, actually. Comparing yourself to them at anything is stupid.\nBack to the topic at hand. Collecting a few extra samples while I'm off the clock should be fine, right? That Skadi op, not to mention Specter and Gladiia... it's not every day we have so many gathered aboard. It's too good a chance to pass up!\nAlso, the Doctor.\nOh, the Doctor. Just a glance makes my researcher's heart tickle. It's so strange... where does that scent come from? Why am I so strongly drawn to it? Do other Vampires have the same reaction? Does Closure... Actually, never mind Closure. She's an exception.\nIf my judgment is correct, the Doctor's body should be hiding some kind of secret. I bet Kal'tsit knows it, but she keeps tight lips, and she wouldn't want anyone else to go digging.\nOh, that Kal'tsit! Kal'tsit! How can you dangle a chance to bare the truth in front of me like this, then forbid me from looking into it?\nCome to think of it, she seems less uptight lately. What if I just... found a chance and gave it a shot?\nHmm... I'll need to plan this one out...",

He approached it with liniment and gauze in hand, applying the medicine in the bottle to the wound before bandaging it up.\nIt struggled a little at first, but was too weak to do anything but accept the boy's treatment before falling into a deep slumber.\nOn the second day, the boy took it back to where it had been found. They wandered through the woods for an entire day until the boy was exhausted and gasping for breath, but in the end found only the remains of two adult fowlbeasts. He built a small grave for them, then turned to it and said:\n'Now, both of us are in the same boat.'\nThe boy took it back to his room, and the tiny nest inside became its new home.\nThe boy would come check on it every day. He liked to gently wipe its plumage while chatting with it, unconcerned with whether it could understand him.\n......\nLike that one night, when the boy approached it with a sullen face and said:\n'I'm confident I have what it takes to be a strong clan leader or a good brother, but I cannot guarantee I can do both at once.'\nThe boy sighed as he spoke. He contemplated for a long time, before finally running off to return with a box that smelled nice. Inside was his sister's favorite dish.\n......\nLike that one afternoon, when the boy approached it with a tinge of melancholy in his voice:\n'I want to graciously wish Gnosis success on his new journey, yet I selfishly hope for him to stay.'\nPerhaps because he had been bottling it in for so long, the boy spent the next half hour explaining to it the situation of the Edelweiss clan, the difficulties facing Gnosis, and his reluctance to part ways with his best friend. In the end, he sighed again and said, 'Alas, you're the only who can hear me out. I'd better think of a farewell gift for him now.'\n......\nAnd like that day when its wounds healed, and the boy took it out to the snowy plains to practice flying. When it was about to take off, he took out a black silk scarf, tied the fabric around its neck, and asked:\n'Will you come with me?'\n—At that moment, the boy had already decided to set aside the burdens of being a clan leader and depart from the Snow Realm to study abroad.\nIt simply cocked its head and looked at him.\nOf course, it did not know what the boy was worried about, why he was anxious, or why he was sad.\nBut perhaps, it sensed that the boy, just like it, did not wish to stay confined in a warm room. He wished to soar beneath the blue sky—\nIt spread its wings and leapt forward.\nThen, to the boy's happy, surprised shouts, it took off with the wind.\nOn that day, it learned to fly once again.",

Physically, mentally, in all sorts of senses... you conquer this height, you touch the sky, you prove your own worth.\nThat seems to be exactly it, yet it's not that simple.\nAt least, to Miss Ensia, it's not that simple.\nWhile in Kjerag, mountain-climbing to her was less about conquering something and more about connecting something. At the foot is her brother, Sir Enciodes, and the whole Silverash family, and atop the mountain is her sister, the Saintess of all Kjerag.\nShe's already scaled Karlan before, and whether to conquer or connect, she's succeeded.\nBut we've received word today that Miss Ensia has taken gold in a Bolívarian mountaineering event.\nAn honor she's put her life on the line for, with dangers beyond anyone's imagination.\nThe hosts' climate monitoring systems had malfunctioned, and the competitors were faced midway with a snowstorm and a series of ice cracks out of nowhere. With the vast majority having no way forward, the hosts announced the event was suspended, and organized a squad to rescue any competitors who hadn't yet returned to base camp. On top of that, Miss Ensia had lost her communications gear, insulated tent, and part of her food supply while escaping danger. In these extreme circumstances, every second longer out there was a matter of life or death, but she'd already overcome the most difficult, perilous ice ridge known to Terra, and the summit was calling. So, should she retreat, or should she turn around and continue up?\n......\nAfter Miss Ensia came to, the first thing she reportedly said to the medical personnel was this: 'The sight from the summit was amazing!'\nThe hosts proclaimed the event still valid, and gave the trophy to Miss Ensia, as the one and only award-winner.\nThe distant peaks beyond Kjerag have none of Kjeragandr's divine protection. Miss Ensia was no more than a competitor from strange parts. She succeeded in planting her flag at the very top, all just for a view of the unknown.\n......\nTo end today's special program, we leave you with a quote from the hosts' speech when they gave the award:\n'She is a true climber.'\n—Special report made on-the-spot by the network after news of Cliffheart winning a Bolívarian mountaineering event made its way back to Kjerag.

          "description": "A fireplace tirelessly burns away in a meditation room lit by crepuscular rays. Generations of Kjerag Saintesses sat here deep in thought upon deciphering their ancient scriptures, digesting the ideas and their meaning to the people of the Snow Realm.\n'Enya. Enya!'\nEnya awakens from her slumber, wipes her mouth, and touches her warm cheeks heated by the fireplace. She flashes an embarrassed smile.\n'Sorry, Kjarr...'\n'Enciodes, Head of Clan Silverash, was just here.'\n'Now? To see me?'\n'No. He had only a few words of blessing for the Saintess and asked me to deliver this to you.'\nEnya takes a small, delicate bell with intricate engravings from the maid. She lifts the thing and gently shakes it, filling the room with a pleasant and melodious ringing.\n'He called it a gift for the Saintess, a product of the factories now operating in Silverash territory. There are many more such bells, hanging in the fields down below.'\nEnya fixes her gaze on the gift. She fully understands Enciodes's meaning. When she was a child, he joined her in making bells from the scrap iron discarded by their father's factories. They hung the bells together with Ensia in the vast fields, waiting for the wind to ring them.\n'Would you kindly stow it for me? Along with the other gifts from before.'\nShe hesitates for a moment before stopping the maid.\n'I recall something in the bottom cabinet at my bedside. Do please bring it to me. Thank you.'\nThe maid returns with a half-finished scarf, clearly made for a man. The soft threads intertwine, the fabric thick, the needlework flawless. What is done can be described as no less than perfect.\n'This must be...'\n'I began making this for Enciodes when he was away in Victoria. I intended to finish it and gift it to him when he returned. For various reasons, it has remained incomplete.'\n'You've kept it with you all these years... You still hold a glimmer of hope for him?'\n'Kjarr, over the course of my life as the Saintess, I've read all the scriptures in the sanctuary. The texts document a thousand years of Kjerag history. And yet, there is one question the scriptures do not appear to answer.'\n'And what is that?'\n'How to knit.'\nEnya falls into silence. She recalls a time, long ago, when her father sat by the window, knitting scarves for his children. Sunlight bathed his face. Her brother was practicing his swordsmanship outside, and her sister was perusing a book of mountain landscape paintings. She quietly watched by her father's side, one needle at a time, committing it all to the deepest part of her memory. This is how she learned to knit.\nThe texts contain plenty of knowledge, but there are some questions they will never answer. Or perhaps she already knew the answer to her knitting question, her family questions, her questions about the future.\n'Tomorrow is the Tri-Clan Council, yes?'\n'Indeed. The other two clans are likely to unite against Clan Silverash. I do wonder how Enciodes will respond.'\n'No matter how he does, in the end, the matter will no doubt fall to me.'\n'Are you so certain?'\n'He is a Silverash, as am I.'\nEnya punctuates her statement by standing up, startling her maid. She uses all her strength to throw open the heavy curtains. For the first time in a thousand years, sunlight floods the dim room.\nShe stands in the light, needles dancing between her fingers. The new thread merges with that already woven. She continues her needlework, not for any man in particular, but for the future the scarf represents.\n'The children of Clan Silverash each walk their own paths.'",

Fins nibbled at our toes then.\nI remember your white sword, and the stone bed beneath me, colder than the stream.\nI recall your carefulness, the tip of your white sword against the newly created soul. They quivered from the magic, ringing loudly.\nYou stopped your carving, you hesitated—was it happiness or sorrow?\nDo not feel guilty, nor apologize, Shining.\nListen, the first note of this night song began sooner than you thought.\nI certainly remember the dried bloodlines that accompanied it, ninety thousand sinful names, and like the vilest curse, wishing to silence us.\nBut do you remember why that pure white suddenly grew warm, why the new soul no longer resisted your sword's tip?\nWhy, in the heavy twilight, could a blue fowlbeast break free from the narrow sky?\nSo small, so fragile, yet its down left a soft glow in your eyes and that silent white.\nListen, I still remember.\nIn that moment, the blade and the pure white resonated; I heard your life bloom along the blade's edge, and the parched sheath could sing anew.\nThe first soul I healed was at the sword's other end.\nShining, do not ask me to tell memories from illusions.\nI never meant to forsake those echoes.\nThey are all part of my night song.\nDry your tears, Shining.\nLet me sing it for you.",

I am not worried at all, because I am confident that with your effort and talent, it is only a matter of time. You are my greatest pride.\nSo more than work-related things, I have something else I would write here for you.\nI know you must complain that your father and I always have so little time to be with you. Please believe me when I say this is also our greatest regret. For us, every time we look upon your peaceful, sleeping face, leaving home becomes a difficult prospect. We never know if this goodbye might be forever, and we can’t know how to say goodbye to you under such circumstances.\nKnow that this field we have given everything to is important.\nHumans are so small in the face of the vastness of the land, but we choose not to be small. It is the search for knowledge that gives meaning to our tiny lives.\nKnowledge leads humanity to surpass the limitations of what we see, pierce through soil and rock, glimpse the true face of this land, and thus tells us who we are. So even at the mouth of a volcano, beholding the abyss before me, I am thinking that we may be able to go directly to the secrets hidden in the depths of the earth.\nThis is dangerous work. I am writing these words now, to a certain extent, in order to ease my fear. I always have reasons to press on.\nBecause this is an ideal I share with your father, and I am fortunate enough to have had a family with him, and your arrival was a gift to the both of us.\nSeeing you choose to embark on the same journey as we have, we are over the moons.\nOf course, we do not see you as simply our successor, and you have no obligation to inherit our career, but we also believe that you will accomplish things far beyond what we have.\nAs a researcher, I see many qualities worth emulating in my daughter. She is meticulous, focused, tenacious, and brave. How happy I am to see this in you! I sincerely hope you continue down the path of scientific research and see your efforts bear fruit.\nYour father and I have left behind many achievements in our research, but the most precious treasure we leave to this great land is you.\nWe want to expand the boundaries of human knowledge with you.\nThat is the goal we are working toward, and you can surely stand on our shoulders to see a clearer, more beautiful world.\n\n—This letter is found in a thick pile of scientific research documents.",

What secret? \nAll the ingredients are all-natural. You just have to put a liiit-tle extra work into it. \nYou still want to know more? \nMy, oh my, you're not planning on just copying the recipe, are you? \nHehe~ Well, it doesn't matter if I write the recipe down for you anyway. This can only be made with local materials from Minos. \nNot a single ingredient can be substituted. \nIt's like–– all my personal memories from Minos distilled. \nThe nights in the Aegean Plain, the peacefully grazing fowlbeasts, the moon settling into the bottom of the lake, springtime in boronia's blossom–– \nI can see it. \nI can feel it. \nThere's nothing quite like it. \nAlas–– 'nothing quite like it' isn't quite right. After all, everyone can enjoy this aroma. \nAhh, just treat this as using your nose to alleviate a little bit of my homesickness~ \nNow, tell me, Doctor. \nWhat can you smell, \nfrom this 'Aegean's Kiss'~~",

          "description": "TO BE EXPENSED: Repairs + installing a music player on motorcycle\nJUSTIFICATION: Motorcycle broke down. Also, would very much like approval for adding a music player.\nOVERVIEW FROM ENGINEERING DEPT.: Fernand II 3-wheel motorcycle, manufactured before Battle of the Four Emperors, antique. Mr. Greypaw conducted fullbody inspection, says original parts hard to find because of age. Re safety: vehicle as old as this should be in museum, not speeding on roads. Greypaw explained this to Earthspirit, Earthspirit stated vehicle originally belonged to mentor Prof. Bachmann. Earthspirit oft. sat in sidecar holding boxes of stones, following mentor everywhere on field investigations. Prof. Bachmann gifted vehicle to her at graduation, and asked her to keep a promise. At present, Prof. Bachmann is deceased. Left only this Fernand II behind, always reminding Earthspirit not to forget promise. Earthspirit rides this motorcycle on vacation, sidecar usually filled with various stones when she returns, plus other Catastrophe Messengers hitchhike on occasion.\nVIEW OF ENGINEERING DEPT.: Given special nature of Earthspirit's dept. plus direct superior of that dept. being the Doctor, this form to be passed onto the Doctor.\n\nTO BE EXPENSED: Installation of suppressor for tuning fork\nJUSTIFICATION: Sound has been bothering people more lately. Seemingly caused by Oripathy? Require installing an inhibitor for my tuning fork.\nOVERVIEW FROM MEDICAL DEPT.: While true Earthspirit's Oripathy has grown severe, no others have heard this supposed sound she mentions. According to physical examination results, the worsening of Earthspirit's Oripathy seems to relate to her continued involuntary continuous usage of Originium Arts.\nOVERVIEW FROM ENGINEERING DEPT.: Tuning fork is Leithanian, custom-order by Earthspirit's mentor for Earthspirit. Rhodes Island requires relevant tech documentation before able to commence investigation of how to limit its output rate.\nVIEW OF ENGINEERING DEPT.: Given special nature of Earthspirit's dept. plus direct superior of that dept. being the Doctor, this form to be passed onto the Doctor.\n\nLEAVE REQUESTED: Visiting home\nLEAVE PERIOD: Apr 1 TO Apr 8\nDATE OF REQUEST: Feb 24\nAPPLICANT: Glacier Wegenie\nDETAILS: Haven't returned home in a long time. I would like to visit, given relative proximity to Leithanien soon.\nVIEW OF HR DEPT.: Approved. Earthspirit was attacked by unknown assailants during a recent field mission, and is presently being treated in the Medical cabin. No adjustment of leave period required, as reconfirmed with Earthspirit. Additionally, Provence + Eyjafjalla will travel with Earthspirit, though given Provence has not returned aboard recently, we provisionally have not received her leave request.\n*Given special nature of Earthspirit's dept. plus direct superior of that dept. being the Doctor, this form to be passed onto the Doctor.",

          "description": "A primer on receiving treatment, circulated in secret between Rhodes Island operators:\n...that case, you're in luck. He'll fix you up and be gentle about it.\nBut if your primary doctor is Gavial, I have one piece of advice for you: don't try and be smart with her, just do exactly as she says. If you've been treated by Gavial before, you know what I'm talking about, and I know you know.\nBut seeing as this primer is aimed at giving all you adorable, blank-slate newbies some advice from the deep end of the pool, I want you to read what follows very carefully.\nFirstly: no matter what rumors you've heard, don't be scared. Gavial is a professional medic who's qualified to practice. Her medical expertise is a genuine thing of envy aboard Rhodes. If she says she's going to treat you, but approaches you with tools that look extremely dangerous (including but not limited to hammers/drills/impact drivers), then stay where you are and do not move. There is a very high probability she IS coming to fix up your wounds. Of course, we can't rule out the scenario where she just seized a bunch of new toys from the enemy as spoils, and really wants to show them off to you, in which case you may express a suitable degree of admiration for her, BUT DO NOT GO TOO FAR, or she may beat you up.\nSecondly: please, follow her medical instructions to the letter, 100%. Don't complain no matter how bitter the medicine she made you take, because she means well. If she's laid down strict dietary restrictions for you, you obey them perfectly, unless you have miracle Arts that let you hide what you've been eating from everyone forever, which you don't. She's a good doctor who takes great responsibility for her patients, and if she finds you refusing to follow instructions, the consequences will likely be Very Bad. The Rhodes Island Medical Department does not accept complaints about that.\nLastly: when you're wounded on the battlefield and need emergency aid, please report in to Gavial ASAP. Otherwise, she may run out of anesthetics, in which case she's exceedingly likely to prep you for treatment using a technique she personally innovated and dubbed 'kinetic anesthesia.' It's been appraised by Medical as 'tentatively safe, but patient experience has been relatively poor.'\nThis author has been a casualty of said technique, and can VERY responsibly report there's a little more to the experience than 'relatively poor.'",

          "description": "Hellagur took the pocket watch and blade from his friend without even a chance to ask a question. The life had already left his friend's body.\nAt the time, he didn't yet know that an unprecedented Great Rebellion was about to ignite war across Ursus, and this lost battle, coupled with the army's disobedience, was only the rebellion's mildest prelude.\nHe could only vaguely sense that, although the storm-in-a-teacup had already dissipated, an unusual calm still lingered.\nHellagur hung the scabbard on his waist and drew out the strange Higashinese sword. He examined it for a moment, but there were no familiar characters on the blade. He placed the sword on the table, presently covered with a battlefield map. The cold and slender blade lay vertically over the tangled front line, forming a large X on the map.\nHe opened the pocket watch to find a photo of a strange girl on the inside. She looked reticent, with only her eyes showing a liveliness and curiosity that matched her age.\nAt that moment, the girl walked out of the shadow in the corner of the command center.\nHer face, figure, clothing, and even the Originium crystal on her shoulder were identical to those in the photo.\nOnly her gaze was different from the one in the photo when she looked at Hellagur.\nThere was no curiosity, no panic, and even hostility seemed thin in her eyes. He could only detect calmness in them, as if her emotional quota had been exhausted by the war.\nHe tried to talk to her, showing her the photo in the watch, and even pointing to the sword on the table, but the girl just stared at him silently, in the same way he had stared at his friend's corpse in silence.\nHellagur realized that, like the sword, this was probably not the first time the girl had been entrusted to someone.\n\nShe suddenly snatched up the sword, which was even taller than her.\nShe held the blade and walked unsteadily towards him.\nThe tall Liberi didn't say anything. The way the girl held it didn't seem like she was preparing to strike.\nOf course, it was possible there were special Higashinese ways to wield the Higashinese sword, or maybe the girl was pretending to make an effort to hold the sword in a way that would keep the edge from being worn on the ground, and he was moments away from having the cold blade pressed against his throat.\nBut Hellagur didn't move.\n\nThe girl's wrist trembled, and she struggled to move to his side. She raised the sword up high, with the tip pointing at the ground.\nHe lowered his head and met the girl's gaze.\nShe seemed to be pleading for something.\nHe didn't know what she was asking for, but he nodded nonetheless.\nWhoosh.\nThe girl inserted the sword into the scabbard at Hellagur's waist.\nThen she spoke. Her command of the common tongue was tinged with a heavy Higashinese accent coupled with twisty Ursine intonation.\n'Don't drop Kudarikiri.'",

          "description": "The samovar whistles lightly, like the snoring in the trenches at the crack of dawn.\nIt was very many years ago, fresh after the close of a violent battle. Their supplies were spent, and Hellagur was left wanting for even a drop of fresh water as his wounded men-in-arms laid by his side stifling deep groans. He pulled a scar-riddled samovar out from his marching pack, and wearily put a potful of snow to the boil. This one samovar would accompany him for a long, long time to come; each time Neon takes a tea break, she'll mumble about how she ought to throw it away, but of course, she's only saying it.\nNeon's letter lies on the table. Which hurts more to an old man: a young child leaving home because they can't be bothered to communicate with you, or a grown child leaving home out of consideration for how you'd disapprove?\nHellagur has been reflecting on whether his approach to parenting might be suspect. At first, he had no idea how to build a rapport with the taciturn child, sure in his mind that there was no way for him to meaningfully raise her. Bitter war, constant upheaval, blight and suffering... He'd seen that all of these had already made their place in her eyes. The best he could hope for was to teach Neon that life was more than these. He brought more into her life, taught her an appreciation for classical music, to play the cello, to read and write... When did Neon change? After she was found secretly taking part in the Clinic's transport of Oripathy medication? Since leaving Chernobog, she's become her own dignified spokeswoman. From settling patients to partnered pharmaceutical research between the Clinic and Rhodes Island, Neon handled many aspects of rebuilding Azazel. Medical and clinical administration were never Hellagur's strong points anyway... Neon often vanishes, only to show back up with a new headache or two for him... Perhaps this was how she always was, but suffice to say, it's how she likes it.\nHellagur is glad he can still protect such a lifestyle.\n...Hence, he regrets not properly hiding the letter.\nThat winter, they'd done everything they could, and had the Clinic's patients, doctors, and medical resources all evacuated from Chernobog... Yet the name 'Azazel' was forsaken there, left behind.\nThese days, new nomadic plates sit atop the ruins, an omnipresent smog of industry and checkpoints and the Ursus Guard, still going by the name of 'Chernobog.' And Azazel has been 'rebuilt' in a sense, the Emperor's overseers tacitly letting it exist. 'Azazel.' The name itself something to believe in. Once, it was a rare respite to those the Empire deemed scar tissue, a safe haven in the endless nights. With no hesitation, the Infected chose where it had once been to come together again, and even the Infected that wandered the wilds and tundras came too, of their own accord.\nTo Ursus, they always were hideous scars. Had the events of 1096 been sufficient to change the Empire's attitude towards them? The answer is laughable. In the so-called 'Federal Territory of Chernobog' is no Ursus Guard, who only care to stand watch outside of it, and to Hellagur, and of course to Neon, the role that the vaunted 'Azazel' plays atop those ruins is all too clear. In the new plate crammed full of Infected, death and disappearance may be diluted in the greater chaos, but they are still taking place, right this very moment.\nThe hot-blooded child cannot stand such a thing. She quietly comes back, brews a pot of tea for Hellagur, and then takes Decapitator and leaves without a goodbye...\nSteam lifts the lid as the water within boils louder and louder, slowly drowning out the sound of the samovar itself.\nQuiet, now. Quiet as the dead winter grass.\n'We can never hope to be an opponent to Ursus. To its traitors, the Empire bestows illusions and humiliation.\n'We can never hope to turn our backs on the past, for it will never be erased. We can never hope to turn our backs on the past, for it binds your future tight. Hellagur.'",

          "description": "In the barrens stands a newly planted flag. No one knows who put it there, nor what settlement it belongs to. It's lifted by a crude pole stuck into the earth, wind sweeping up sand and flying the banner straight.\nA passerby sees the design upon it and is struck by vague familiarity, but where he's seen it before totally escapes him. A cloth with the same design covers the grain pile back at his home, dust having long worn that special symbol away.\nHe sees the towering flag and pulls out his hatchet, thinking to cut the flagpole down. The fabric seems sturdy and strong, the pole suitable for firewood. Unwanted by anyone, he may as well chop it down and put it to better use. Just like how every settlement in this stretch of the wild fights one another over soil and resources, ultimately evolving into ever more brand-new civilizations.\nThe axe hacks into the pole, but cannot cut it. He puts a hand out to shake it, but the flag defiantly flies even straighter in greeting the sun. He hocks a glob of spit onto the ground, shifts away from the light, and squints his eyes as he looks up. The material's very new. Not yet stained by rain or dirt. The burlap flaunts its sheen.\nA few days ago, a mechanical arm brushed aside the traps set all around its cabin home, picking flax from the long-forsaken waste, and weaving as its Mom and Dad once taught it. The hand so used to bows was somewhat clumsy, but the metal hand briskly rolled the flax into thread.\nSuppose one said this arm used to be treasured for how it could draw a bow with greater force—now, it had its owner's full interest for how meticulously it could weave. But the mechanical arm understood none of this; it simply followed its master's will, making good on what she saw fit.\nA few years ago, the arm's owner thankfully told the old man that installed it how she would use it to further her revenge. In time, she used the greater force within it to loose arrows into the bodies of mercenaries. She looked at the things they left behind, at the unfamiliar symbol on them—the story of her. Time stopped here, and not a soul remembers all that he was before. She pulled her cloak off, fixing it tight to the wound that almost saw her windpipe slit open. Revenge can easily wipe away a person's past. She didn't want to turn out the same way when her demise came.\nSo she returned to her home, wove this mantle, sought out a firm flagpole, and stuck it rigidly into the soil.\nIt is the final remaining symbol of this settlement in the wilds, and she used her vengeful arm to weave this memento of civilization. The flag rises, the steel arm's owner walks her new path, and those who pass by the banner will recall the pattern she wove.",

The Disaster I'm In – The Nonbelievers (5:31)\n(A red heart is drawn next to this)\n2. Declared Innocent – The Fire Axes (4:37)\n3. ■■■■■■–■■■■■■ (■:■■)\n(Heavily scribbled out, along with a note written in another color: 'The beat's all wrong. Will get hurt if listened in battle.')\n(There's an arrow pointing to another line of text below that reads 'Storm Riders – The Fire Axes (4:00)')\n4. Taking Back My Tears – Fantasy Realm (3:30)\n\nThis is the second backup tape I've made. The first wouldn't play after being soaked.\nWhile re-recording, I swapped out one song on Side B that didn't fit. It had a weird beat, which messes up my breathing whenever I swung my axe to it.\nBut switching it out left a little gap in the mixtape, and the total playtime went down by 22 seconds. It wasn't seamless anymore.\nWhile worrying about it, I heard the sound of someone practicing an instrument in the dorms. The sound of the metronome was really nice.\nSo I pressed record in the hallway and filled those 22 seconds with the ticking of the metronome.\nI still don't know who was practicing that day, but I'm really grateful to them.\nI know how to write a lot of words now, so I can write all these things down.\nThe nice lady in Medical also encouraged me to write my feelings down more often, but I don't know what words to use to capture my ever-changing mood.\nJust like how every tape has a side A and a side B, our feelings also have sides, and they're always pulsing and changing.\nI like the rhythm when my feelings pulse. Like a drumbeat. Like a metronome swinging from side to side.\nI like a calm rhythm when I'm alone, and an intense one when I'm on a mission. These rhythms are my own, and they won't ever end.\nThere's no room left to write on this paper, so I'll leave it at that.",

Anna wasn't any better; though she was clearly trying to keep her emotions in check, I could tell that she was panicking. Sonya felt like she had a duty to protect the others, so she kept her hand tightly gripped around her axe. I always thought her hand was going to slip one of these days.\nUnder that atmosphere, everyone was constantly on edge. And to make matters worse, nobody knew if what we were doing was right or wrong.\nLada wanted to be of help—she felt like she was always sheltered by Sonya, and was afraid of being left behind—so she'd go out and try to find us something to eat, though she came back with empty hands most of the times. Anna wanted the group to be more 'stable,' so she'd try to strike up conversations, but they seldom went the way she wanted. Sonya was generally in high spirits, but every so often she'd come back with an extra wound or two.\nEveryone did their best to get something done, as if they'd go mad if they didn't. Though sometimes, you could get rid of the 'as if' part.\nAs for me, I was never that scared in the first place, but it's not like I'd have been happy dying there. I didn't want to lose Sonya and the others either—we'd been friends already. So, I also did whatever I could: bringing back supplies, helping Sonya 'take out the trash,' and even teaching some harsh lessons to anyone who tried to lay their hands on Anna.\nAt first I thought things would get better, but it was actually the opposite. Lada and Anna started avoiding eye contact with me, and even Sonya would strangely glare at me. That's when I understood: I'd been robbing them of their agency.\nBut I was better at those things, so why shouldn't I do it?\nOf course, I was never the petty type, and it's not like Lada or Sonya really blamed me for that. I knew they were both real nice, we just didn't know how to get along back then. It wasn't until the day Sonya came back from a scuffle with a serious tear in her uniform and Anna used a sewing kit I'd scavenged to fix it up that I realized what I needed to do.\nI snuck into the warehouse, found some coats, and brought them to Anna to ask her if she could fix them up into something more cold-resistant. We'd need them later when the weather turned cold, and sure enough, she cheered up at that.\nAfter that, I risked my hide to steal some Reunion kitchenware for Lada so it'd be easier for her to cook, though obviously it was better to keep that part low-key. Her eyes lit up the instant she saw what I brought back.\nI even found some self-defense equipment for everyone, and modified them with Sonya. While we were working together, I thumped my chest and said to her: If there's anything you want, just say the word and I'll get it for you. Sonya stared at me for a while, but this time, she nodded.\nLooking back now, it was probably around then that our team actually started taking shape.",

Once evenly folded in, add the fowl yolk. Dice the dried berries finely (full chunks will be slightly sour). Sift in pastry flour, knead until smooth, then trim and cut into 4 x 4cm squares.\nNB: If these are for Sonya, make bigger. Natalya likes more salt in hers. Drizzle honey for Rosalind's.\nPlace in freezer to rest for 1hr, then transfer straight into a preheated 170°C oven for 20min until done.\n......\nI see... And I thought all along the chief would turn out to be the true mastermind! Now that I look back at previous descriptions, he did plenty that he wouldn't have done otherwise. Blatantly letting the protagonist go on with the investigation, making such a solemn vow at the meeting, and him and his wife truly being in love all along, not a political marriage... He even began by committing suicide...\nThe author's deliberately crafted narrative tricks may have had their impact, but I did still let first impressions blind me to many unusual details.\nIt may be that people truly can be affected by information from all sides given specific circumstances, and end up overlooking facts that should have been obvious.\nI've overlooked a lot, that much is true.\nThis is something I'll have to reflect on frequently in future.\n......\nI've borrowed several books from the Doctor throughout my time here at Rhodes Island. As a student, I've certainly been through things most others my age have not yet. It's beyond me to more deeply comprehend some conundrums posed in books with my current level of knowledge, but with my experiences, perhaps the author's intent is something I can feel out.\nPertinently, the passage on the 'mass' in Chashcha Lesa: 'Those who have done wrong once find they are not punished, for those around them who know of it will opt to turn one's blind eye to carry on living one's 'days of well-being,' so accordingly the wrongdoers will then go to do wrong a second and third time. May there merely be one willing to fix their firm eye and raise their voice, and this chaos can be dispelled.'\nMay there merely be one willing to fix their firm eye and raise their voice, and this chaos can be dispelled.\n\n—Excerpts from Istina's reading notes",

She's going to put lots of sweet, sweet honey inside them, with extra jam and fresh, crunchy nuts. She's decided she's going to make them really big, and share them with all the people she loves. That way, everyone can eat to their heart's content, and every bite will be super sweet.\nWhat could possibly beat taking what you love, and sharing it with who you love?\n............\n'Let's get our stuff ready to move, Lada. It's gotten bad. We can't stay in the school any longer.'\nOn hearing what Sonya says as she enters the classroom, Lada hops to it without needing to think, following her leader with not a moment's hesitation.\n'Sure, I'll pack everything now.'\n'Hold on, Lada.' Anna, to her side, calls her to a halt and hands her half a honey spice cake. 'You should eat something too. Essentially all of the school's food has been torched. We're lucky you were concealing this spice cake in the first place...'\n'Hell of a big one, too! And sweet!'\nRosalind laughs boisterously from behind Sonya, followed by Natalya joining in the praise. 'Just a single bite silences the hunger. We were blessed to have you, Lada.'\n'Damn right,' Sonya nods, before furrowing her brow and addressing her directly, 'but you're barely eating anything. You've just been splitting with the rest of us. Didn't you share your cookies with some other guys too?'\nEat some more, Lada. They practically push the food into her hands.\nLada cups half a spice cake in her hands, not daring to blink, and turns to face away from the other girls in the room.\nThe Little Cub sniffles as quietly as she can, squeezing out the tears in her eyes and wiping them away. She presses her cracked lips together and lifts the spice cake up. She mimes a small biting motion, her teeth carefully shaving just a tiny bit from the top, the smallest possible bit of pastry and filling, and holds it in her mouth.\nSo sweet.\nHow can something be so sweet? She's never had a spice cake so delicious before.\n'Alright! I took a biiig, big bite!'\nLada turns back around, stuffing the spice cake into her bag and meeting the girls' concerned gazes with a smile.\n'It's true! I put lots and lots of honey in when I made it! Now I'm ready to go, I'm not hungry at all anymore!'\nAs long as she can be with the others, the Little Cub thinks to herself, no matter what she does, she won't have to suffer, or get tired, or fear anything ever again.",

          "description": "Chernobog.\nNatalya curled up her legs to cover them with the plastic sheet. She already knew how to get a little warmth while sleeping alone, and how to avoid being discovered by other refugees or the Reunion Movement. It wasn't actually time to sleep, but she was too tired. In hopes of getting Lada a little soup with flavor for her fever, Sonya grabbed half a leather belt off another group of refugees. And, of course, they didn't let her go easy. They chased Sonya all the way back to their hiding place. The commotion woke the already weak and drowsy Natalya. She used the huge weapon she had been carrying on her back for the first time.\nA few days ago, they dragged it out of a burnt-out ruin, and after inspecting the remaining parts, despair yet again cast its shadow on their hearts—it was practically unusable. Natalya describes it as a former siege weapon, now abandoned. Several eyes looked it over only to fall into silence.\nBut Natalya still found a few almost-usable cloth straps and fixed the huge device to her shoulder. Anna and Sonya said nothing, they just clutched their own handy weapons tightly and walked on in silence. Natalya followed.\nThe massive weapon now rested across the bottom of Lada's neck, covered with a layer of found fabric, making it just a little bit softer. It didn't actually fire anything that could cause any real damage in the recent scuffle, but Natalya stood in front of a few already-broken refugees, and snapped off a component of unknown function—the weapon worked strangely, a mixture of thick black smoke and flames gushed out, igniting the debris next to it. The fire drove off the refugees who were pursuing Sonya, meaning they lost their own hiding place.\nSeveral hands tugged at the plastic sheet in the corner. Anna coughed weakly, trying to muffle the sound in her throat. Sonya stared into space with her eyes wide open, not allowing herself to sleep. The flickering flames in the distance reflected on their faces. The feverish Lada suddenly clenched her fists and woke up from her sleep, muttering and grabbing the small pot next to her, preparing to rush out.\nAnna skillfully placed her hand over Lada's forehead, and Sonya pressed down the corner of the plastic sheet to prevent the wind from coming in. Through the gap in the sheet, they saw the dark night sky, glittering stars, and Natalya, still cowering alone nearby. Lada murmured and reached out to her, and after grabbing her equally pale hand, she quieted down and slowly fell back asleep.\nThe next day, Natalya felt an unfamiliar warmth beside her. When she woke up, she saw a small, yellow, dirty star-shaped plush toy hanging off her weapon, swaying back and forth. Lada wrinkled her nose and laughed.\n\nRhodes Island.\n'Please wait a moment, Sonya. I'm not ready yet.'\n'Ugh, you suck, Natalya.'\n'Listen, you're a logistics operator, and you're the one who applied for a replacement weapon. How did I end up being the one pushing <i>you</i> through the process?'\n'Because I suddenly realized that I've gotten used to it.'\n'You've never even fired the thing. The last time you tried, the pile of scrap almost exploded on you.'\n'I know how maximally utilize its functions.'\n'You told us it was a military siege weapon.'\n'Well, I like its color.'\n'Ugh, are you screwing with me? Do you wanna use it or not?'\nThe white-haired girl laughed. She fiddled with a dirty, tattered, star-shaped plush toy behind her back and remembered the night when she huddled with her companions for warmth.\n'I've changed my mind. I don't want to replace it. To me, Sonya, it's more than just a weapon.'",

Comms were cut off before Weiss could state the precise location, leaving Enciodes's guards no choice but to provisionally surround him. Shields and blades firm in hand, they noted, out of the corners of their eyes, the Caprinae woman standing by their master's side.\nThey were all sure that with this Caprinae bodyguard by his side, no attempt would ever succeed. They just needed to coordinate with each other and settle this chaos while keeping casualties to a minimum. Not to mention, Weiss managed to get the most critical part of the message out, so now all they had to do was wait patiently for the enemy to serve themselves up.\nBut they didn't get to await the enemy.\nIn fact, when they caught sight of the traps on the mountain that had taken down a dozen or so of said enemy, the guards, shields and blades and all, were momentarily shocked—just a few branches hidden in the snow, plus flint blades fashioned out of rocks struck together, formed traps no one would ever notice and yet which sunk circle after circle of blood into the white snow, a faintly sanguine pink even leeching into the tundra some meters out.\nAnd strewn all along the tundra were the enemy's now frozen severed limbs, as well as blood and pulped flesh hacked free from Weiss himself, forming mound upon mound in the snowfall. Sunk into the dismembered parts were wounds fierce, firm, and even visibly wrathful, while the cuts on Weiss that bared bone made every guard wince.\nItra do not reign supreme in sturdiness, and though Weiss's abilities excel, he is only human. Only a single member of Enciodes's guards, one who spends a considerable amount of time merely couriering Kjerag's letters to boot. People are fond of the faint scent on the letters he handles, and of his cheery face, and they admire his loyalty to Enciodes.\nBut no one would've imagined he had this side to him too.\nWhy? Nobody had asked Weiss to go so far. Being all on his own, simply passing on the word would've sufficed. He could've found somewhere to hide, and mustered enough defense to cope with this spate of traitors.\nEnciodes looks over Weiss, but makes no move to ask him anything. Weiss sorts out the letters and documents on the table and deferentially excuses himself. Before the door closes, Enciodes hears a cut-off remark vanish into the wind: '...live up to duty.'",

Her groans, each higher than the last, drew the livestock close one after another, forming a circle with her inside. Those livestock were warm of fur—so thick yet fine—keeping the blizzard away, and the hot breath from their mouths and noses became a wall, providing enough warmth for your mother's labor.\nYou were born, your face so filthy, and you bawled in tears. I put out my hand and caressed your eyelids, shut so firm, my rough skin brushing the corners of your eyes red. I was born with a pair of wide, rugged hands, in which your grandfather took pride, saying I would be a man who could feed his family, but that day they caused you to cry without end.\nThen your mother swatted away my hand in annoyance, and I laughed, about to pull my finger away, when your arm found its way out from your swaddle and gripped my finger tight. You see? You were only but the size of my hand, yet you made me panic like nothing else, and I stood there dumb in the snow, not moving a step.\nThe blizzard that had been screaming outside forced its way into this delivery circle the livestock formed, the red retreating from your skin, naked to the wind, and an ominous purple spreading over. Your mother opened the fore of my robe and pressed you against my bosom. Carefully and cautiously I wrapped it again, as if caring for my own second heart. And your face frozen frigid by the cold was warmed by my body, and finally you ceased to cry, and simply sucked your fingers and took small, weak breaths. Then your mother climbed onto my back, and called for the livestock to return home with a whistle. Their tumbling hides bounded across the gentle, narrow slope down the mountain, and I was like their leader, with her riding tenderly on my back, and you so frail against my chest, though my legs shivered as they sank into the ankle-deep snow. Like I was bearing the weight of all the land.\nThat robe later opened a hole right at its chest, which must have been from some Holy Hunt or other. Last year your mother unearthed it from our wardrobe's depths, where I had all but forgotten it. Your mother chose to repair it so finely it in the end, and asked if I would still wear it. I shook my head no, saying we would best send it to you. I'm well into my age now, and stoop more with each passing day, but you are in the prime of your youth, standing tall as the mountains, never to fear the north wind nor the icy snow. All else aside, I want you to have it. I imagine you'll look just the same as I did when you wear it, no? So wear it, and come drop by. My chest may be shriveled and dry now, and my robe run through with holes, but it's still far enough to keep a heart safe.\n—Letter from Father",

Ugh... purse bleeding out. Heart too.\n7th\nShone the whole dang day, might of blown a thermometer, but they got this new flavor of pastry in at my favorite street stall. Lined up an hour and a half in the blazing sun, belly burnt red. Used some ointment from Sora and it worked real well, stopped hurting before I even went to bed.\n10th\nAll clouds. Purchased a new umbrella. Savings blown, be eating instant noodles all next month. Would of been frugal some the past few days if I knew. Got some left over for a rainy day anyway.\n17th\nCloudy but turned clear. Red-braised rib flavor instant noodles taste pretty dang good. Could eat for a whole week without getting sick!\n20th\nClear but turned cloudy. Ate all the red-braised rib ones, just tamagoyaki chive flavor left. It's fine, but I can barely get it down.\n23rd\nI'm all out of instant noodles... not one pot left. Thank all goodness for Texas sharing her cookies. Swear to my starving eyes, for an instant she had holy light beaming round her face.\n24th\nStorming!! Sunny like heaven when I got up. Pedestrians all walked by my umbrella stand, none of them turned an eye, all kept walking. But gloomy clouds rolled in and everyone got caught right out. Drenched to the bone! And I sold out of umbrellas basically instantly. Score!\nKiller profits like that don't grow on trees. Should save it at the bank, play the long game. Always had an idea tucked deep in my heart—get an emporium of my own, right here in Lungmen.\nMaybe time to get started on that. Little sum like this seems like nothing compared to the sky-high rent in Lungmen, but it's a solid start.\n31st\nNew combat boots out, my favorite brand. Shouldn't of done it. Act rash and now nothing but regret. Maybe... Should spend a night reflecting proper on my deeds. I must be a terrible sight when greed goes straight to my head. Life's tough...\n1st\nHey, new combat boots come in real handy! Might of hurt my heart to spend so much, but was worth it. Not a waste, not one bit!",

They drip the blood onto the tree root, and drape the meat atop a branch. Thereafter, they let out a string of perfunctory syllables, ones that even they don't know the meaning of.\nNot far away, their daughter skips about on her feet. She'd want to hold onto her parents' hands, but today her own hands are occupied. It's her first time headed outdoors with her own weapon, like the grownups do. She remembers how her parents taught her that to take up a weapon is to fight, and fighting demands she be vigilant at all times, so she always keeps her bow in hand, arrow nocked on string.\n'We have to teach her these things,' she hears her mother say. 'Teach her how to draw her bow, sharpen her knife, lay her traps. Teach her not to fear, to have the skill to meet any battle... That's the only way she'll survive. There'll come a day when they find out we're Sarkaz. Nowhere accepts the Sarkaz.'\n'Listen... you promised me we'd never go back to our old lives.' That's her father's voice. 'And... you promised her. Don't you remember? There was a rainbow that day. You watched as I ran into the forest with a kneeplate, to try and catch it with.'\n'She wasn't born yet then... oh, never mind.' Her mother's voice becomes soft, tender. 'I'll teach her, but I'll pray too, even if it's absurd for a Sarkaz to pray for the blessings of Sami. So long as they don't find us deserters...'\nTheir voices gradually fade, for the girl has her attention drawn by a roughly hewn wooden carving to a side of the path. She knows that where it points to will be a hollow filled with wonderful things, and that when her parents run out of something at home, and can think of no solution, they search for hollows like those. She wants a knot in rainbow colors, and so she follows the pointed direction, squeezing through the gaps in the trees, freeing one hand to collect berries along the way, plus some pretty stones, all of which she tosses into her quiver, preparing to exchange with the hollow.\nEventually, unwittingly, she has entered the thicket where the wild beasts lie in wait.\n......\nIn later years, the Sarkaz girl forgets all she experienced in childhood. Forgets how her parents called her name as they searched for her, forgets the colors of the knot on her wrist when she lifted her hands to surprise them.\nAnd she forgets, too, her parents' reaction.\n'You see, you see how it was she survived...' The man calls his lover near, all the while pointing at her quiver, incredulous.\nAnd so the Sarkaz couple sees that at the bottom of the tiny quiver, there lies the damp trace of melted snow.",

She was hungry and couldn't help but take a bite out of it.\nThe boss said she had to pay for it. Ceobe couldn't pay so she took out a broken arrow and a glass tube that she didn't know where she got.\nIn the midst of that business, Ceobe heard someone shouting outside, 'Thief!'\nCeobe grabbed the bread and rushed out.\n\nThe second thing she couldn't understand was why bad people would steal wallets and make it hard for people to eat bread.\nShe was chasing a motorcycle, and the motorcycle was vrooming along the field. And then the sky was getting dark. She got tired of chasing, but the bad guy was still sitting on the motorcycle.\nShe heard the bad guy shouting excitedly, 'She's been chasing us all this time! What kind of monster is she?! Let's fight her!'\nThe motorcycle stopped, and then the bad guy ran over with a metal stick and got knocked over with a 'thud' sound.\nCeobe held the bread and looked at him.\n\nThe third thing that Ceobe couldn't understand was why other people could suddenly hear weapons talking too.\nThe people who got their wallets back surrounded her. She stood in front of the boss and said she wanted to keep the bread for herself. That's because she heard the bread talking to her, and the bread was also a weapon.\n'What did the bread say?' the gentle boss asked her.\nCeobe tilted her head and thought for a while, and listened for a while: 'The bread sounds like a grumbling stomach.'\nSo Ceobe left the houses and the very flat road with a large bag of bread. The bread that could be used to hit people didn't talk anymore and became too hard to bite, which was strange.\nCeobe thought that one day she could come to understand these things.",

          "description": "I always thought if I just make puppy dog eyes at Vulcan, I could get her to do anything. But when I told her I wanted to make a weapon, she got all serious and said no.\nShe said I just wanted to play, and I wasn't taking it seriously, and I wouldn't learn it right.\nI even promised that if I didn't learn it right I wouldn't get to eat anything yummy, and she still said no. Not even wagging my tail worked. She was a like a rock, and I couldn't make her budge at all...\n——————————\nToday... the little steel knife I just bought... broke...\nVulcan says they used bad steel, and the forgework was suspect, so it would've snapped fast even if it wasn't me using it.\nI don't get it, the words just fly past me. Inside my head it's all empty, so empty I can't think of anything.\n......\nBy the time I snap out of it, Vulcan's at work.\nShe looks at me, stops what she's doing, and puts a big chunk of metal in the furnace.\nThen she pushes her hammer into my hands, and makes me hold it.\nThe cloth on the handle is still sort of wet, and warm, and it's hard to get your hands off once you're holding on tight. But it's really heavy too. How does she swing it so much all the time?\nI want to ask her something or other... um... but she's staring at that metal chunk. It's all red now. Better not bother her.\nThe furnace is kinda roasting the air. When she's not watching, I lightly tap my palm with the hammer, so I can imagine what it'd be like swinging it with all my strength.\nIt's gotta hurt a lot.\n......\nAfter a while, Vulcan pulls the red-hot metal out from the furnace and puts it on the anvil, then takes the hand I'm holding the hammer in, and swings down with it.\nThunk!\nMy hand kinda hurts, and my ears are humming a little, but I'm super duper happy, so I don't mind it at all.\nIs this forging? Is Vulcan teaching me to forge? Am I gonna become an awesome blacksmith just like her?!\n......\nNo, I can't do it...\nEven though she's been next to me all day teaching me what to do, all I made in the end was this metal... chunk? Strip? Sheet?\nThe surface is all dented and bumpy, and there's no sharp edge. I can't beat up bad guys with it, just bonk them.\nNow I've wasted her good metal. She's gotta be really mad...\nShe... gave me a little biscuit and said I did pretty well?\nReally? Am I good at this?!\nHeheh~\nI think I'll keep it with my other baby weapons.\nMaybe it's not all that pretty.\nBut it's my knife, and I made it.\nIt's really strong, and really hard.\nIt can clobber bad guys and shoot out super lightning!\nI love it~",

          "description": "At the border was a fellow of Li, who tilled. He dug up an idol, of more than a chi in length, formed like an armored soldier, vividly lifelike, but its nature was unknown. He gave it to his son, and his son loved it very much.\nThe fellow's son once carried the idol with him to the neighbor's boy to play, imitating an expedition. The idol was light yet sturdy, and all else that touched it fell afoul. The neighbor's boy brought out clay burial figures among others to serve as troops. None could withstand, and he was greatly angered, and abruptly took a hoe to the idol, whereupon the hoe broke and the idol was unharmed. The fellow's son treasured it all the more, always sure to place it by his pillow, thereafter falling asleep.\nThe neighbor's boy told his father of the idol. The father was covetous, and sought to rob it upon hearing of this, believing it to be valuable.\nOne day, upon the city docking in remote regions, the neighbor there entered the house of Li at night, seized the idol and left, to enter the city in his greed to offer it to a noble.\nBefore long, he met a person, who spake: 'To walk at night is very tiring. Rest for a brief while.' He did not answer. Again the person spake: 'The idol in your sack is an infant's toy. I bid you know this; it will not bring you reward, but instead suffer you calamity. You should return swiftly.'\nThe neighbor was greatly startled. He knew he had met an extraordinary one, and could not balk for a moment, only mumbling his assent. The extraordinary one knew his intent, and laughed grandly. The neighbor dared not raise his gaze out of fear. Shortly the laughter fell, but the extraordinary one had thus left.\nThough he feared calamity, he did not return, instead hurrying fast for the city, but the idol in his sack grew all the heavier, and shortly he could not carry it on his back, and dragged it. In an instant his strength was depleted, his mood in great turmoil. Fearful the extraordinary one would take the idol, he thus fell upon the sack, and as he looked all around he wept, and in the end could not abandon it.\nAt daybreak, a merchant passed by, and saw a man lying sound asleep. Before long, he awoke with a start, grasped the sack and spake: 'Do not take my idol!' But the sack was completely empty. The merchant believed him crazed, and left him behind. Thus he was in a daze, returned home, and there fell deathly sick.\nThe son woke, looked all over but could not find the idol, and wept greatly and did not stop. Told by some that the neighbor had thieved it, the fellow of Li sought to question the neighbor, but found him of grave illness, and instead made no question.\nThe townsfolk believed the idol inauspicious, and the son argued with them. And unsuccessful, was angered but spake no further of it. The fellow of Li, fearing his son would walk the neighbor's path in life, sought for it with great care. His son did not become crazed, but began to study forging and casting. Some asked the son of it, and he spake: 'I know the idol is not born of magic, it is the work of real man. I will cast a new idol to prevail over it.'\nThe son grew somewhat older, and forged and cast relentlessly, ingenious of mind and divine of spirit, and word of his reputation reached the capital. A department examined his talent, and weighed him well. He was selected to become a Tianshi.\nFive years later, the son cast an idol, and offered it to all at the Ministry of Works. This idol was fashioned after an armored soldier, clad and equipped full and well, of nature light yet sturdy, and did not rust even when aired to the sun or lashed by the rain. The High Minister was alarmed, and sought to ask of it, and the son told him of what happened in childhood. The High Minister fell silent and did not respond.\nThe son of Li lived to ninety and passed, and his marvelous skills have been passed down to countlessly many, and even now still have their employers.",

Thick green they grew and prostrated, to ye who sired their ranging lengths. Your words rang hard as mystic seas, your name on land as heavens high. All was your mastery to make, the crafts exquisite and profound, the natural realm would aid your might.\nAnd when you did relate with common man, there was no soul in Yan who'd not admire your character and moral gait, that mut so fearsome could be so humane, and not a soul would fail to call your name in praise for such pure kindness held, for where was such a beast as fine as ye! They speak of ye who cherished life and would not see it wanton smit, 'twas ye who soothed all into peace, made clouds and rain of it to bring Yan good portent, that you would scheme of strategy, would kill the others of your kind to see the land be gold in time. How selfless that you were, how giving to the end, our honor be!\n......\nSo when you passed away, the mounts and lakes joined too to mourn, the grass and grain did weep along, and all were moved by what a heart you bore; across it all did mists collect and wind in layers thick, the autumn gusts time and again blown with their baleful cold; they saw the clouds now and bemoaned that they could see no end, at river's rage they now bemoaned how stop it never would.\nSo once you passed away, and each incense stick burned to nil, and all my brethren parted thence, they left me here to guard your rest. All that you bid was failed and left adrift, and young and old all know this well. O wouldn't you regret this woe, for who would see such torment be? Soul such a wretch that hundredfold flesh still mayn't truly you return?\nO Sui o Sui, the seasons will memorialize, your deeds turned into song and dance, and what a ■■ing scene.\n......\nI further note. The True Lung told me this: While you remain in here, I cannot freely roam. The deadline of a hundred years, that's come and gone, and I'm extremely bored, so here I take my leave to find a decent hotpot place.\n\n—Candle lit and door rapped thrice, the Sui Regulator Candleholders entered to find the guardian of the tomb absent. All anyone found was an inscription in the walls of the southeast corner, carved cuttingly deep. From the style and contents, it can be discerned that this was presumably left by her as an... obituary to Sui?",

All formed things, false.\nBut that animacy, that spiritful will, gives some ever-so-slight joy to Dusk.\nShe suddenly feels a little of her mood return.\nHalf a day later, the small being is lively across the wealth of her canvas.\n'That old idiot would have even more pointless words for me if he saw me brushing life out of nothing.'\n'But still...'\n'The way this realm has no bearing on how you are, I suppose that's a little interesting.'\n'No place of place amidst high mounts or waters far; no matter to me free amidst the human realm.'\n'That's it.'\n'I think I'll call you 'Free.''",

The lyrics were vague and resisted understanding, and its repeated retelling seemed to have corrupted it several times. However, the events directly referenced by the warped lyrics led the Candleholder to be uneasy. When he inquired with the children whether they knew the meaning of the lyrics, and where they heard it from, they unanimously shook their heads. Left with no alternative, the Candleholder transcribed the lyrics and let the children return home.\nAfterwards, the Candleholder got in direct contact with local authorities, requesting they bolster security administration and enlist more emergency workers to respond in the event of sudden disaster. At the end of that autumn, a flood broke out in the area. With grain harvests under thirty percent of previous years, it was fortunate that local authorities had long since prepared, and were ready to send in grains from nearby cities, leading to no further unrest. Post-disaster reconstruction work was likewise completed smoothly.\nAll aforementioned events have been recorded in Sui Regulator files.",

          "description": "Saria stared at the old gloves before her.\nThey had originally been locked away in a closet in the Director of Defense's office, Rhine Lab HQ. Her departure had been too rushed to take nearly any personal items. And they should have cleaned out her office long ago. So why save these? Why send them to Rhodes Island? And why now?\nA few days ago, at the intervention of the Maylander Foundation, construction ceased on dozens of unlawful experiment sites. Certain people had bribed officials in the municipal planning department to circumvent the necessary auditing procedures, and used fabricated plans to deceive the ethics review committee. Business as usual. Saria had spent months on the move to find evidence of their illegal dealings—fortunately she'd gotten ahold of Anthony Simon, along with his sources. Ultimately, over half of the test sites shut down had belonged by Rhine Lab. Maybe that was why these boxing gloves turned up now. A warning, or even a reminder.\nThey were hardly the first boxing gloves she'd ever owned. Those would be the ones her father gave her, clearly unfit for a child, which always chafed her skin to the point of bleeding. But she persisted and did as her father told her, pounding her weakness into a sandbag, along with all her *impractical* emotions, punch by punch. Others had minds filled with openings, so one moment of complete disarray was all she needed to shatter their defensive line in a single punch. Saria was never as enamored with fighting as so many other boxers were: for her the skill was simply a means to survive until now.\nUnconsciously, her fingers read the ridged words along the back of the gloves. 'Trimounts Institute of Technology'—she'd once taken part in an intercollegiate tournament with these. She spent many a late night in the boxing club back then, always with a plus-one tagging along. That certain someone wasn't a fan of the sport, nor was she interested in the tournament, but hung around simply because 'varying your environment prevents your mind from getting stuck in certain lines of thought.' She wasn't joking: not much later she proposed the concept of a hand-mounted exoskeletal operating system, based on observation of Saria's own movements. That system was still in use to this day, in the office of Rhine Lab's Control.\nThough they hadn't seen use in so many years, the gloves looked as snug as ever. Saria very nearly put her hands in them, but a slight ache from beneath her shoulder blades held her back—apparently a call to adjust the dosage of her painkillers. The mercenaries outnumbered her in her last investigation, after all: a whole platoon against one .\nIt meant she was gradually getting close to the truth.\nA few minutes later, Saria let go of the gloves, stowing them in the lowest drawer of her temporary desk, and once again picked up Ifrit's latest physical report.",

          "description": "'The proof underpinning this paper derives from a veritable ocean of experimental data. The sheer quantity of fungi and cellular strains engineered and nurtured is on par with that invested in by national-grade research projects... 'Usage of biomaterial to substitute for or induce regeneration, make targeted modifications to portions of organic functions, thereby creating a new species with superdistanced traits over a long period.' It's a vision for which many problems still remain on the technological front, but it is doubtlessly a direction worth looking into.'\n...\n'Aside from its academic merit, we see in this paper a quality rare and sought-after in a researcher: a keen insight; an objective, meticulous, and prudent attitude; as well as a consideration for the ethics of science from beginning to end. In the conclusion, the author even spends a whole section demonstrating that should bioengineering develop the way she imagines, it will lead to a clash with Terra's present life sciences, biology, pathology, clinical medicine—and she also expounds on the means necessary to control it, e.g. reining in procedure.'\n'Quote—'Science's forward-facing outlook entails both unknowns and destruction. Science will broaden our horizons, lengthen our strides, and enrich our forms, but it should not become the power which ruins all.' It astounds me to imagine that a student so young has such a self-critical mindset, the clarity of which marks her among the most outstanding researchers. It is invaluable, and worth rejoicing over.'\n'I can already picture the bespectacled, pensive, undernourished youth who must have written this. Perhaps we might catch sight of this young Saria at the seminar tomorrow.'\n'I look forward to her continued plowing of the field. No doubt the laboratory's the best soil for her to grow in! She'll become an exceptional scientist.'\n...\n'Oh, yeah, what do you think of this paper? It's the complete opposite of Saria's.'\n'Who'd start a paper with 'All opinions expressed in this text find origin in the comprehensive misgivings about the situation we are in'?'\n...\n\n—Excerpt from a transcript of a Maylander Foundation academic seminar during the public evaluation stage",

          "description": "A great wind comes from the depths of the desert, blowing straight across a boundless meadow. Beyond it is a nomadic city, its night as bright as the day. \n'This wind––' \n'What about it?'  \n'I'm not sure how to describe it right now.' \n'Even the great wordsmith, Ling, has times when she's lost for words?' \n\nThe wind first passes through the eaves of the garden, swirling around the head of the willow tree. Its power largely spent, it brushes against Ling's face, as if scratching an itch. \n'The company of friends, endless cups of wine. The warm wind brings me––'\n'I flipped through your recent poems...' A sudden voice rings out. \n'Brother...' \n'Warm wind, fragrant wind, easterly wind, lotus wind, willow wind, wind across the bridge, wind beneath the fan... Why don't you try going somewhere without wind for a change?' \n'Is there any place in this world that doesn't host any wind?' \nShe can't remember how many poetry meetings she has attended recently - pretty much the same gardens, the same meandering water, the same thousand cups of liquid you couldn't get drunk on, the same hundred poems, the same charming emotions. To make merry is fine indeed, but it is too easy to make merry. \n'There may be a place that needs you more... somewhere that'll let you compose new poems.' \n\nIn order to control its only water source, this nomadic city does not rely on the mountains as a barrier, but rather stands on the vast desert, like a lonely giant in an unfathomably vast world with nobody else to rely on. The great wind rouses, occasionally kicking up rough sand and dust that passes across one's cheeks like daggers. \n It's not as if there's no wind here - it's just not that same kind of wind. The mountain's sanctuary is distant, the spring wind's breath expired. \nLing stares at the meadow but a stone's throw away, where the last of the remaining elite soldiers lay, their armor covered in wet spikes. Three whole battalions, yet the meadow at night is nothing but a meadow. \nAn ambush took place here. The city that rouses the night was the bait, while the meadow was the trap. \n'Light the torches brighter.' \n'They're already bright enough to attract those guys.' \n'It is for the soldiers beneath the meadow to see. War comes soon, and none shall return. Nobody can resist the urge to turn around and look. Burn them brighter, and they shall become the lights of their hometowns.' \nThe great wind cannot extinguish the flames in the meadow, the men's eyes fix upon their homes through the night. \n\nA cold wind blows, the senses stir. Her eyes open to the depths of Shancheng's night. Empty jars of Husong wine fill the pavilion, a half-written poem on the page in front of her.",

He feels—\nShattered.\nThe pain bites at his consciousness, charging straight at its source, and it seems that this wisp of smoke, this tiny flame is his body. No, he remembers that he had once been able to analyze all things in this world, level mountains and lay waste to cities with a flick of his tail. However, his consciousness should not have arisen from the midst of this chaos, for that which slumbers yet sleeps, and naught has changed since. The tendrils of smoke weave their way through the netting, sinking down to the base of the censer, where the wispy cloud swallows him whole. Why do I awaken? Why do I struggle? Why is it that at the deepest part of this tomb-like jail, there is an even narrower cage? His eyes become smoke, and he gorges himself on his own body, letting off a roar of fury at the nothingness before him.\nThe smoke shifts imperceptibly, as if a minute breeze has swept across the chamber of stone. He remembers—\nHumiliation.\nA great hunt, his defeat, the shame engraved on his bones and inscribed on his heart. His fury draws a picture of the past, where the strong were brought low by the weak, ancient time was overwritten by fleeting moment, and gods were toppled by commoners. The True Lung bled before the people, boiling copper and molten gold pouring onto the earth. For three thousand days and nights, smiths chiseled deep ravines into mountains, casting myriad forms of weapons. The altar became a stronghold, and the robes of the devotees burning incense concealed blades of edict divine. Yes, this was the price of such trickery. An incisive punitive strike, a wound that could not heal. The traces of this humiliation still reside in his body, and he plans to use this wound as a mold to cast a sword.\nA flame bursts forth from the censer as if pumped by a bellows, and the Candleholder on guard rings the alarm bell. He raises—\nA blade.\nWithin the boundless gloom, there are still other consciousnesses being born. At the moment, those consciousnesses are not as lucid as he, but they are as he, and they too seek to surface from the depths of this turbid pond. He still remembers how mortals would describe this sort of relationship, and he understands that they will be his... brothers and sisters. He endures the pain, as though his stomach had been split in twain, and flicks his wrist. The cloud of smoke bursts and dissipates, his sword rending apart heaven and earth from within the chaos.\nThe primordial fog shrinks back, and gloomy night becomes brightest day.\nThe Candleholders rush into the stone chamber, and the Imperial Guards surround the tomb layer by layer. At last, he feels—\nFreedom.\nThe smoke rises from the censer in spirals, standing steady on its stone platform. In the depths of its belly, the Feranmut yet slumbers. He feels that his own body has become lighter, as if he has turned into a wisp of smoke rising through a hole in the censer, floating across the heads of the Candleholders and Imperial Guards, floating past the sealed stone door of the mausoleum, floating through the skies above Baizao, towards distant lands.",

          "description": "'Hey, Tianshi Shu, there are some things I just don't get no matter how much I think them over, and I thought you could help teach me.'\nShu raises her head, the Tianshi apparatus that was hovering before her gracefully collapsing into a cube before falling back into her palm. Her young visitor's arms and legs were hooked into the branches of a tree, her hands grasping some brilliant red fruit, her sharp eyes quite unlike her youthful figure hanging upside-down, and staring at the apparatus in Shu's hand.\nShu laughs, holding the apparatus tight, and says: 'It's rare to see you in the fields. Do you not have schoolwork to mark?'\n'That group of layabouts? Let someone else who cares take charge of that lot!' The child wipes the fruit with her sleeve, gobbling down a bite, its sweet scent clear even from two or three zhang away. 'What about you? You're hardly an ordinary person yourself, so what are you doing mucking about with a Tianshi apparatus for? Can't you decide how good the harvest will be with a point of your finger and a glance of your eye?'\n'And what if I don't have this mystical power you speak of? What if I have simply seen enough to know if the weather will change, or if the seeds will successfully become crops?'\n'You do, though! Look, don't play dumb, I'm asking you seriously here.'\nShu stoops down towards the field, her cloud-like tail slowly sweeping across the chilly crop ridges. These plants had just passed the seedling stage, and would soon join the sprouts that had been brought onto the agricultural plate alongside their fields, gleaming in the burning embers of the summer evening.\n'Springtime drizzles wake the seeds, grain buds dance in summer's heat. Autumn gifts the crops their gold, but they can't stand winter's cold.' She recites this softly, as if reminiscing on the prior night's dream. 'One person's strength alone could not order the myriad grains everlasting. But before I was I, before Shu was Shu, there was already someone who had achieved half of what was dictated in this song of the jieqi solar terms.\n'A thousand years hence, those that came after her created this Tianshi apparatus. It can take on six forms, knows how seeds will develop, can share data between different plates, and can direct Sky Poles.' The little green cube floats above Shu's palm once more. 'Although mine is somewhat different, its functions are still interlinked: whether it is the song of the jieqi or a Tianshi apparatus, they are but manifestations of the power of the architecture of time.'\n'Pah.' A fruit pit leaps into the heavens like a signal flare, its furious rise startling some featherbeasts roosting in the tree, only landing far away a long while later. 'Forget I ever asked. Breaking out some old Shennong cliche again to avoid the question, how boring.'\nThe child leaps down from the tree, walking off along a small path without another look. As if coming to a sudden realization, Shu lightly claps her hands.\n'Could it be that the reason you came... is that you don't know how to use an apparatus? How about I go ask He Sheng to teach you...'\n'Don't talk rubbish!'",

          "description": "Off went Platinum to Sami for her vacation.\nShe'd invited the Doctor too, but just as she didn't hope for a raise to her pitifully low Rhodes Island salary anytime soon, she didn't truly expect the Doctor, buried somewhere under that mountain of paperwork, to tag along with her.\nStill, she got herself two months of vacation. So that was great.\nAfter setting foot on Sami soil, a Columbian graciously led her to her villa. Snow was falling on the plains, and across it quietly traveled a procession of people, the one at the head bearing flowers plucked from who-knows-where. They all silently followed him, walking towards the lakeside.\nAmongst them, a child slipped and fell to the ground, and Platinum helped them back up, petals falling into her palms as she did. Her mind flicked back to the past, when she was still an independent knight. To fans flocking to give her flowers—beautiful ones, fragrant ones, ones that seemed like they'd last forever. The flower-bearing procession was now some distance away when she had the sudden urge to see who they were giving them to.\nLooming by the lakeside was a deep white altar, all around which they laid the flowers.\n'They're honoring the memory of a deceased hero. The one leading 'em's a descendant. It's a custom of their tribe,' explained Platinum's Columbian hire.\nThey cast the flowers into the lake and began to dance, singing a nameless song whose melody was deep and somber, and they beat a flame alight. Some wept, while others spoke silently mouthed words, pure and reverent light flickering in their eyes.\nPlatinum and the Columbian watched from afar as they shared food around the bonfire, before they drew she herself in. Language failed to connect them, but mood did not, and there she tried a cup of local wine, and was given a red flower by an elderly woman.\n'Too noisy...' she thought. Soon after, the child who'd fallen over pulled her by the hand and merrily spun around, running as he did for the bonfire before bringing more food back.\nShe accepted his kindness, and watched the people before her.\nThe tribe raised the hero. The hero fought Ursus all his life, then died on the border. Countless descendants had come in his memory to tell her, a simple stranger, his story. The story of an escaped assassin, of what was hidden inside a meat pie cut open and swallowed by knife and fork, of a soft napkin wiping non-existent bloodstains and crumbs.\nThe lakeside was a distance from the plains, and the Columbian still stood wrapped in a blanket far away, illuminated by the villas' twinkling lights, waiting for Platinum to give the word to lead the way. Platinum stood by the bonfire, simply watching the people, never saying a word.",

          "description": "In the wake of Kjerag slowly gaining fame, so too have Kjerag's snowcaps become better and better known.\nAmong them, nevermelting Originium ice crystals, as a symbol of sincerity, have become even more sought after.\nSuch ice crystals do exist, but acquiring them is a challenge. Only at the peaks of the most dangerous summits might they possibly be found. Numerous people drawn by the allure have ultimately found themselves leaving empty-handed.\nStill, not a problem for Gnosis. The Edelweisses—once generational guards of Kjerag's archives—would know the Snow Realm better than anyone.\nIn his eyes, the difficulty lies in the climb.\nIndeed, despite spending his childhood years in Kjerag, he much prefers absorbing himself in archives. His family relocating to Victoria only saw him devote practically all his time to studies.\nThus, even after he'd followed Enciodes back to Kjerag, he never once showed any interest in taking on the mountains.\nBut today, he sets foot into them alone, following an ancient notebook as he ascends a remote peak. There, Originium ice crystals wait in silence for their unearthers.\nAs he regards them, Gnosis cannot help but reminisce.\nThe dream was power and prosperity for the nation of Kjerag, but the method of realizing it continually evolved as he studied in Victoria. His ultimate conclusion, he had to accept, ran counter to that future he and Enciodes had envisioned together in their youth.\nWhich was why, he recalls, that as they parted and made their promise, he felt an unprecedented shred of defiance—would Enciodes come to Victoria? And should he, and should the rift in their consensus be impassable, what then?\nIt came to be that Enciodes did arrive. Never had they clashed before, but they knew how each other's ideals had diverged in parts. Even so, with a shared dream in mind, still they firmly took each others' hands.\nAmidst the Snowcap Incident, he thought to play him at his own game, to employ more radical methods to corner Enciodes.\nThought, assessment, hesitance, and thought again. In a desolate corner, idea upon idea spun through his mind. He could do it himself, he thought. In the end, he did nothing.\nWhen in that room they put hand in hand once again, he knew his choice had been foregone.\nIt seems Enciodes has conveyed the Doctor an ice crystal. Gnosis has decided to procure one too, but does not plan to gift it to anyone.\nWith the Snowcap Incident behind them, on this day as banal as any other, he treads alone into the mountains for one thing only—he wants to forge this ice crystal into a sword. A gift for himself.\nThe blade it creates would be useless in combat. Should he ever replace his weaponry, it'll need to be made separately. But that is of no consequence, for he has no plans to fight with this blade. No, it won't even see the light of day. It'll remain hidden, forever.\nThe crystal symbolizes unwavering loyalty. Never has he shown such a thing to Enciodes, and never will he. He will be faithful only to his own choices.\nAnd his choice is—\nThe comms terminal at his belt vibrates. A communications network has been erected across the whole of Kjerag by now. Even upon the snowcaps, one can receive dispatches.\n'You have a meeting.'\n'Understood.'\nCarefully, he chisels off an Originium ice crystal and stows it away, before heading back down the mountain.\nBeing the CTO of Karlan Trade, his free time is few and far between.",

During his escape, he tumbled into a hole blown open by an explosion, and found the long dormant Lock and Key by accident.\nWhen he was 20 years old, he became a Caster, and quickly earned the praise and respect of those around him, thanks to the Lock and Key's power.\nWhen he was 30 years old, he had amassed great wealth and a reputation he could have only dreamt of. Yet, he had long since ceased to care about any of that. At some point, he began to talk to his staff day after day. Everyone thought he had gone insane.\nWhen he was 40 years old, he suddenly disappeared from inside the palace one day, and no one knew where he'd gone. Rumors began to spread in certain parts of Kazdel that a madman would tell certain impossible predictions to anyone who passed him by in the barrenlands. For example, that a giant beast would soon lay waste to our nation and that the sky would one day tear in two and reveal its true face. Afterward, he would peddle his watches to whoever stopped to listen, and should they refuse, he would bring their time to a halt.\nBy the time he was 100, he no longer knew where he was, but that no longer held any meaning to him. He believed he was seeking the secrets behind time itself.\nHe had the Key, but where was the Lock?\nHe had the Lock, but where was the Key?\nThe past becomes the future, and the future shall have no secrets. Day after day, he talked to his own shadow, firmly believing that the truth was hidden within.\nUntil one day, footsteps echoed throughout, as three Sankta walked into the underground palace.",

          "description": "'Pasha, Your Excellency, this is the fifth story I've told for you. I hope it was to your satisfaction?'\nIn the resplendent palace of Sargon, a blue-haired Messenger, dressed in attire markedly different from those around her, stands at the foot of the steps, bowing respectfully toward the Pasha seated on his throne.\nOn the high platform, the richly dressed Pasha gestures to his attendant, whispering something to him. The attendant's face briefly shows a hint of surprise, then he steps forward to loudly announce the Pasha's decree—\n'Messenger, my lord had never heard of such ruins hidden within the Black Flow, nor of the history buried within Victoria's ancient battlefields. Your stories have greatly pleased him, and he is willing to forge a friendship with Yvangelista XI from afar.'\n'Thank you very much.' The blue-haired Messenger gives a polite and confident Sargonian court bow and begins to turn to leave. But the attendant speaks again, 'Don't be in such a hurry, Messenger. My lord has one more question for you.'\n'Please, go ahead.'\n'My lord wishes to ask if you would stay and tell him the remaining nine hundred and ninety-five stories?'\n'Does... His Excellency the Pasha mean that he wishes for me to relinquish my role as a Messenger, and remain by his side?'\n'Precisely. My lord offers you wealth and luxury here, in exchange for sharing with him all your enchanting stories.'\nThe blue-haired Messenger smiles. 'I thank His Excellency for his kindness, but I am accustomed to my life of freedom; such riches and luxury are not suited to me.'\nThe Pasha whispers a few more words to the attendant, who then steps forward again. 'You are already an outlier among the Sankta. Your kin will not accept you, and your homeland has no place for you. Why go to such lengths on their behalf?'\nThis time, the blue-haired Messenger pauses to think before answering, 'I don't journey for my kin, nor do I long for my homeland. In the beginning, it was an old friend who set me on my travels. Now, I travel out of curiosity for a certain story.'\n'What kind of story?'\n'An old man once told me a story before I left. It was a silly story about everyone eating ice cream together under the sun. But as I traveled, I began to see what was intriguing about it—and as I reflected more and more on it, I discovered even more stories.' The blue-haired Messenger gives another courtly bow. 'You should instead let me travel as far as possible, so that when I return, I may regale you with even more wondrous tales.'\nThe Pasha no longer tries to persuade her, only ordering that, whenever the blue-haired Messenger returned, the palace gates would always be open to her. As they walk out of the palace, her red-haired companion, who had been silently listening all along, finally can't hold back and asks, 'Did His Holiness really tell you a story like that?'\nA smile appears at the corner of the blue-haired Messenger's mouth. 'What do you think?'",

The climate in your area is comparatively frigid; be sure not to catch a cold. \nThe experimental samples you gathered for me on a prior occasion were plenty apt for our requirements, and in excellent condition; my colleagues have been profuse in complimenting your work. \nAll of them are burgeoningly curious about you, to the point they're even hoping you'll work with us on formal terms. \nIf you ever change your mind, and wish to seek a presentable job, you would be welcome at our laboratory. \nAll that said, there is something I need to tell you. \nI plan to depart soon for a company by the name of Rhodes Island. \nI've told you bits about Ifrit before, and I have no other choice. \nI need to take a moment and consider just what it is I want to accomplish. \nI'm sure the words seem ridiculous, given I've always told you to do what you want for yourself, and not to squander your time. Here I am, in the end, only now realizing I can't form a clear picture of what it is I even want to do. \nI'm certainly not qualified to be lecturing you on this occasion. \nOn another note. You have a certain fondness for elaborate toys, so I've made you a Rubik's cube. It's open to being dismantled, and there are some tricks to it. I trust you'll like it. \nMay your future be bright. \nSilence",

I've been having a few sudden, intense aches, I think the part where I got scratched hasn't healed normally. I've already taken stock of everything for today, and those people who didn't like me didn't follow as far as the store. No worries.\n\nA note stuck on the shabby bottle of perfume reads:\nThank you for always being with me all this time, and always being able to find me. This is a present for you. I know it's far from enough as a thank you, so if there's anything else I can do for you, please be sure to tell me right away.\nAlso, my sickness is mostly set to keep getting worse... If in time, this present can remind you of me every now and then, then I'm happy. It's alright if you can't remember me too.\n\nA note fallen in the market's grit paving reads:\nHello, do you need help sorting out goods or cleaning up dust? I can do other work too. I'd like to work in exchange for some food. You might not notice where I am, but please don't worry. I'll do everything as earnestly as possible.\n\nA note trapped beneath the dagger reads:\nMission complete.\n\nA note stuck in the corner of the bulletin board of a Rhodes Island lounge, almost covered by the neighboring rainbow of stickers reads:\nEveryone at the get-together sang very well. I didn't think it was one bit noisy. But if you decide to move to a more soundproofed room next time, could you put a notice up on the bulletin board beforehand?\nThank you to the person who recommended me drinks. I liked that sour and sweet dark orange one a lot.\n—Manticore",

          "description": "After the regular checkup, Dr. Gavial wanted to take me out drinking, and I turned her down. It's not that I don't like her or anything; I think she's a fine person. I just don't like things that are a pain in the ass. \nIt's noisy as hell, there's alcohol, wrist wrestling, and inevitably, a little girl named Tomimi always shows up... Any single one of these things in isolation, I can probably deal with. Some, I might even call cute, but when you smash everything together, that's what you call a pain in the ass. I much prefer enjoying a glass of juice alone on the deck to spending a night at the bar. \n\nI'm almost out of juice. \nOne nice thing about being alone is that it's comfy. One not-so-nice thing is the fact that you get bored easily. \nI open up my toolbox with the mod kit and start to do maintenance on my 'gun.' Guess it's one form of entertainment. \nTwenty seconds, it's completely disassembled. \nEighty-one seconds, every part's squeaky clean. \nThirty-five seconds, the lubricant on all the metal parts has been replaced. \nFifteen seconds, the reassembly is complete. \nIf the thing in my hand was the real deal, I'd be able to do a whole lot more with the mod kit. Unfortunately, it's just a weirdly-shaped crossbow that fires a special ink bullet. Doesn't actually use Originium or anything sensational like that. \nSome things only work in the right hands. Trying to force them onto others won't end well. \n\nJust as I was deciding if I wanted to get a second glass of juice, I hear a few other people step onto the deck. Other than the sound of their footsteps, they aren't making any other noises. The people wisely keep their distance from me and stop on the side of the deck. \nBefore long, I hear a soft singing voice from them. I look back, and as expected, it's a group of Abyssal Hunters. \nAs soon as I see the three of them, my heart starts to beat faster. I once told to the Doctor it was love at first sight, though of course that was a joke. In reality, my best guess was that this unusual physiological reaction was probably related to that incident when I was a child. But I've never asked about it, nor do I think about it much. Wouldn't be able to get any answers anyway, and all the thinking in the world wouldn't solve the problem. In the end, I'd just be causing extra issues for myself. \nAnd I have a hunch – it'd be a hundred times more of a pain in the ass than Gavial dragging me to a hundred bars for a hundred nights. \nSo, as long as that thing stays far, far away from my daily life, I'm good. I have no desire to throw myself headlong into something that's gonna be a pain in the ass. \nBut occasionally, every so often... \nWhen I close my eyes, I'll see that person. I have no idea who that person is, but I can tell, they're at the center of this whole mess. \nSomeone wrapped in the smell of the sea, a robed Iberian... \nI stand up and sling the gun over my shoulder, pick up the only toolbox messy enough to be my own, and go to grab my second cup of juice.",

          "description": "ID tag #1, code name 'Blunt Wedge'.\nThis was her first time receiving a commission as a mercenary. The mission: the most ordinary caravan escort. The journey was estimated at five days, and on the evening of day 2, she picked up on another group of mercenaries targeting the caravan. In the dark, she readied her defenses. Early morning on day 3, she noticed the single mercenary squad tracking them had become two, and a plan to flee with her life began to form in her head. On the night of day 4, the two squads launched simultaneous raids, but took each other as enemies and initiated a firefight, in the end taking everyone down. No survivors.\n......\nID tag #10, code name 'Heavy Arrow'.\nThe mission: escort refugees to a neighboring town. Mixed in with them was likely a military spy, but that had nothing to do with her. All she had to do was hold off a different mercenary group who had come for their lives. Aiming to rescue a Sarkaz child who had drifted away from the group, she spent three days and nights in a confrontation with an enemy sniper, in the end shooting them dead. When she located their position, she found the sniper she had shot was a Sarkaz too—and not much older than the child she was saving. After that, she left Kazdel.\n......\nID tag #17, code name 'Meteorite'. The final tag.\nShe was hired by some organized militia in Kazimierz to take part in guerilla combat against the Ursus Army. Unlike her former missions, the guerilla squad was as close as family. They also didn't treat her in any particular way for being an outsider, a Sarkaz mercenary. She even made a friend among them. Never do good things last forever though, and due to a defector, the guerillas took a devastating attack. When she clawed her way out of that sea of flames by the skin of her teeth, she saw her friend at her side throw a disgusted, furious look her way.\n......\nAt present, this string of tags has been handed over to Rhodes Island along with a list of names. The 'Meteorite' tag is a very unusual one, with no blood type on it, nor any squad affiliation. Just the code name, engraved in its center. On the back, a phrase is etched in the Sarkaz language.\n'May the Sarkaz never suffer again.'",

Not that I'm saying unlocking things isn't what a police officer should do... just...'\nIt's just that she finally gets to do something she's dreamt of since the beginning.\n\n'We've been attacked by an armed group, and we're low on heads! Division Three requesting backup!'\n'How are you, Division Two? Send two for emergency support! Hold on until HQ get here!'\n'It's Grani's team... She shouldn't be taking assignments like this...'\nThe fleet transporting the convict come to an emergency stop under the sudden attack, and though they're prepared for this, the numbers they're facing still exceed the mounted police's expectations.\nGrani holds a defensive posture behind the escort vehicles, the convict still inside, held by a teammate—they're not letting the door open again under any circumstances, as per code, so no worries about the subject.\nAfter that comes devoting everything to prolong the ceasefire as long as possible, waiting for support.\nBut her superior's words just now get Grani a little mad. She's heard words to that effect more than enough times, yes, but today's her first time on an official assignment, and she thought that was recognition of her ability.\n...Guess it wasn't.\n\n'All you need to do is stay here and defend the vehicle, and wait for us to sort this out.'\nGrani watches her two seniors run in armed against their fire, and they take down one, two... even more of the enemy appears from behind the bunker, shouting 'There's only two of them!' and rushing... her seniors and teammates suddenly fall, they pull their hands from the wounds they were clutching, and Grani sees palms red with blood.\nThe parked fleet creating its own highly useful bunker, Grani conceals within it and launches charge after charge. Her teammates have lost hope until they see her routing the enemy's formation, and they're hauled back into safety one after another by this pint-sized girl. The opposition so much as beats a retreat for the time being.\n\n......\nThe support squads following up take over the task of escorting the convict, and Grani keeps her injured seniors and teammates company on the way to a nearby hospital for treatment.\nBit by bit, she's been changing the way people see her, and though she's never rejected herself, getting the recognition of others is something that pleases her all the same.\nGrani dusts off the badge on her shoulder, a bit of ash stuck to it from the conflict before, and now it glimmers bright.",

          "description": "Every graduate of the Victorian Royal Guard Academy must go through one final, major examination before their formal ceremony.\nAnd these were the exam details Bagpipe received: infiltrate a logistics warehouse in south Castshire County, and rescue a civilian abducted by local bandits.\nBefore departing, Bagpipe was called to the staff office.\n'Do not alarm the local barracks or the police.'\n'Do not bring unrelated affairs in this.'\n'Do not sustain injury.'\nThese were the three requirements her teacher relayed to her.\n'Are these orders, Mr. Slim?'\n'Ugh,' he sighed, looking her up and down. 'Take this as a request from me to you.'\nEarnest, Bagpipe jotted these three requests down in her pocket notebook, and at the top, she gave the 'rescue!' she'd already written before a mighty underline.\nThe first half of the mission went without a hitch.\nShe infiltrated the target location, laid under a container, waited a full ten hours, and finally the bandits showed.\n'How about her?'\n'Shut her by herself in the red car. How do we handle her?'\n'How? How do we handle her? YOU do me a clean bloody job is how.'\nThe red car. Bagpipe's ears immediately caught the key words, and she locked onto the target without any wasted time.\nLights out for the two bandits posted in the car, and she found the civilian, anaesthetized and unconscious, as well as catching another group's conversation.\n'They all staying put?'\n'Drugged them good. Not going nowhere.'\n'IDs in order?'\n'Baron helped sweeten the police. They move fast.'\n'Any other locals noticed?'\n'Noticed? They just came from Sargon, plus they're all criminal. You think their families'll want to come looking for them?'\n'Alright, then we're off tonight. Got a dozen labs in Columbia poking us in the arse to get this done.'\nTwo seconds Bagpipe hesitated, then she opened her notebook to look. Three seconds her eyes lingered on the first line, and then she shut it.\nThe sound of a freight lorry's ignition reaching her ears, she glanced left and right, then found the largest parked vehicle around, and with the mission objective on her back, hopped into the driver's cab.\nEngine on, accelerator down, nice and easy.\nThe freight lorry didn't get very far at all, before running straight into a container crane that showed up at the entrance out of nowhere. Driven like it was possessed, it smashed half the warehouse wall while it was at it.\nA few minutes later, the alarmed police scurried over, and led away twelve bandits all seeing stars, as well as Bagpipe, who'd lost a bit of skin off her left index finger.\nOnce back at school, Bagpipe sought out the teacher.\n'I'm sorry about those three requests. I couldn't even manage one of them.'\nFor a long while, the teacher was silent, before picking up a recommendation letter to hand her.\n'Ehhh? Storm Company? Could I really, Mr. Slim?'\n'I had the letter ready long ago.'\n'Oh, thank you, sir!'\n'That said... do you know who the person you got into a car crash was?'\n'The mission target, right? No?'\n'A soldier from the Storm Company acting as an unconscious civilian. She and her squadmates were tasked with taking out those twelve bandits in the first place. By the way, thanks to you, their mission's already done.'\n'So where was my target, then?'\n'In the car accident. Don't worry, none of them came to harm, and they're all home safe and sound now.'\n'Then, umm, then... I completed my mission after all?'\n'You did.' The teacher patted her on the shoulder, let out another sigh, and spoke. 'You pass. After you officially report in for duty, you'll be allowed real Fortcracker shells.'\nBagpipe's eyes went wide. Realizing her teacher meant she could be like all the other students, cheering and celebrating their own happy graduation, she pumped her fists, the excitement growing vast in her face.\n'I was thinkin', odd that 'civilian' was over two meters! And she was just too cool! Can-can-can I really be squadmates with soldiers just like her? I... oh, do I need to think of a codename too? What did you say they all use? Instruments? I... hold on, I don't even need to switch codenames then! Sir, sir, is there anythin' you think I should probably bring when I report in? I dunno, d'you think they might not like mince puddin'? Oh, and, and...'\nDon't fault me for this, Rita, trust me.\nYour teacher can't help knowing she's a true good student, and she'll be... she'll be a fine soldier too, for sure.",

          "description": "'What's all that?'\nThe pawn shop owner fretfully pats a child in the midst of a coughing fit in his arms, not giving a glance to the visitor laying out wares on his counter.\nFor just a wee instant, Bagpipe's shocked to find she can't give the answer to his question. Right, she's more familiar with these two things than anyone. What were they again?\nRight, a stick and a sack.\nIn a hay pile in County Kevin, the stench of almost-fermenting Originium slug mucus bore its way into her dreams. There came an uninvited, extremely peckish old manglerbeast, dripping saliva over her face. Subconsciously, she took that iron stick and gave its head a fierce drubbing, and that was how she lived to tell the tale.\nOn a gravel road in County Peninsula, a checkpoint soldier dragged her out of the merchant's crate she hid in with such grip strength that her arm might've come off. Quickly and resourcefully, she stuffed her documents between the layers of the sack, and bluffed her way past by pretending she was a vagrant bard setting off into the wilds.\nOr, well, was it a crowbar and bugle?\nIn a mire in Connor County, a mercenary's Arts almost shaved the tree above her flat, and her fortcracker's ammo case chose to be difficult at the exact worst time. If it wasn't for her crowbar being just sturdy enough to lever the case's handle, she'd probably be gone on the spot.\nOn the white sands of Castshire County, a soldier gave her life before she could give any last words, the wounded commandant couldn't sound the bugle, and so the unmarked grave lay deathly silent under the beating sun. At least the instrument she had on hand was able to sound clear enough a tone, such that they could send their deceased comrade off with some kind of a decent farewell.\nRight. These were a crank and a set of bagpipes.\nIt was the biggest tractor of the whole village, and the crank it came with was long as half her arm. The arm she dislocated trying to show off that she could do a quicker job than her mum at starting the engine. Sitting on the tractor on the way to the hospital, though, her laugh ended up luring half the village's burdenbeasts after her.\nAnd the pipes made of young cystybeast hide, downy tartan sewn to it by her mum. The village all knew her unique knack for spinning around while she played them. And of course, none forgot how earsplitting those wistful tones were as they echoed all through the village, back when she'd just learned them as a bairn.\nShame that now, after prying a case and doing in a mangler, the crank's bent out of shape, and won't be starting a tractor no more. A dirge played and papers concealed, the pipes are leaking, and won't be playing a tune no more either.\nThe shopkeep squints, peers, then fishes out two grubby coins from under the counter. All up until now, these were what she had left of home. But at the least, with these two coins, home can send her on her way just this once more.",

Keeps dragging me into arguments over 'the meaning of medicine' and 'the right track' and 'having a responsibility.' Like all of that isn't just phony self-servicing junk.\nThe market ain't no peaceful place, but at least it ain't noise that cares about me. Besides, it's not like I'm a stranger to life here. Just reliving the good old days on the lam with the old sleazebag, am I right?\n'Thief! C-Catch him!'\nMan, every day they put on the same dull crap. I'll hand it to the tourist though, a guy with no strength in his right arm stealin' your bag's pretty hilarious. And hopeless.\nActually, check that out, I think the thief's a familiar face? That's the poor sucker who came to me for a detox in the middle of the night. He had his whole gang carryin' him around like a swollen eggplant hopped up on growth hormones.\nLooks like I went a little too easy on him. Man, I knew letting the poison wreck his left arm more would've been a good idea.\nI've said it before, medicine's not gonna stop harm at the source. If Hung thinks he's so smart...\n'*sob* Grampa...'\nYo, hassle just keeps findin' me. Don't you dare look my way.\n'D... Doctor? You have to save my grampa, he's my only family...\n'Save how? The old man's practically counting the days. Maybe someone can lay him in a nice sandalwood coffin, give him a decent exit. Either way, that someone ain't me.\nThink it was a night like this one too, just after the rain lifted. My pops was down for the count after takin' a stray bullet. He dragged me to hide in some street corner he found. Dude hoped I'd take on his mantle. Maybe relieve his pain, or... just straight up address it.\nThe way he went out was kinda ridiculous. Rememberin' how he loved to own the whole unlicensed doctor thing just makes it funnier.\n'*sob*...'\nScrew it, I gotta do somethin' to make this kid quit crying so ugly.\nWe'll take watermelon, lychee, and pineapple flavor, mix 'em up, squeeze out the bubbles, aaand... perfect, this med's gonna please the crowd like nothin' else.\nC'mon, old timer, give your grandkid some peace of mind. Lemme jab you up nice and good.\n'Huh? Grampa, are you awake? Grampa? Doctor, why is my grampa laughing so hard...? Grampa, stop laughing, you're gonna make me laugh too...'\nHey, a few side-effects comes with the territory. Also, never call me a doctor again, or I'll tell you straight to your face that even if he lasts the night, he—\nWhatever, <i>at least</i> he can last the night.\n......\n'Cooking skills won't stop starvation at the source either. Are you saying that's pointless too?'\nWeird. How come Hung preaching at me just flashed through my brain? Yeuch, guess I'm gettin' a little peckish, though...\nHuh? The kitchen lights are still on... dude, Hung, did you not go to bed yet?\n'Here, your midnight snack.\n'After you're done, wash the dishes, then put them back in the cupboard. They're good habits to learn.'\nThe hell? Here he goes again, educating people without asking.",

          "description": "Every day at half past six, Hung turns on the TV and begins to prep the day's dinner to the tune of a wuxia drama's deathblows and battlecries. There were tremendous lines at the hypermarket today, and it's already past seven by the time he gets back, with the wuxia on TV long since over. But he leaves it on out of habit anyway, and shuffles over to the kitchen to cook.\nThe meat's red and tender; Hung decides he'll mince it and mix in fresh spring onion, planning to fill two tiers of buns. With the meat neatly stacked on the cutting board, Hung picks up a kitchen cleaver in each hand and assumes the Meat-Chopping Stance, when suddenly a mournful wail comes from the living room TV.\n'You've fallen into my hands, Zhong Dafa! You know your blood debt. It's time you finally repaid me!'\nThe cleaver drops with a bang, not into the meat, but straight into the cutting board. Hung shakes his ears—he only hears intermittent gasps and sobs. With no clue about what's going on, he continues the work at hand. A short while later, he tosses the filling into a bowl, and is just about to pour in a few drops of sesame oil when—\n'Stop, Dacai! You can't kill him! The truth is, he's your brother!'\n'Huh?' Hung abruptly lifts his head in disbelief, face blanketed with confusion, beginning to suspect he just heard wrong. More voices immediately follow.\n'Ma, how can that be? I don't believe you!'\n'When I divorced your ba, we each took a child. We never thought it would lead to a mess like this.'\nHung wrinkles his brows, squeezes the bottle of sesame oil, and barely gives it a single shake, only for way too much to pour out, and the bowl of mincemeat to smell to high heaven of sesame. He heaves a sigh and lays the rolled-out pieces of dough in his hand to wrap the buns, all while his ears stand attentively pricked, as if hoping to catch whatever audible clues the television might make next.\n'Hmph. No need to hesitate, Zhou Dacai. Just do it.'\n'Ma, what do I—what do I do...'\nThe buns he is pleating shut are incredibly lopsided, and he finally stops what he's doing and devotes his full attention to the ensuing conversation. Unfortunately, however, someone seems to have changed the channel, and the TV is now playing video game noises, with Waai Fu and Aak's clamorous voices reaching Hung's ears soon after, followed shortly by the sound of Lee coming in. Hung shakes his head and smiles, and places the uniquely shaped buns inside the already-boiling steamers.\nThe clock's hour hand has been on eight for a while now, and Hung gently uncovers the steamers, the clouds of billowing steam revealing the plump white meat buns before him, as the filling's scallion scent slyly wafts from the kitchen and spreads through the living room, subconsciously luring the people towards it and the table.\nThere'll always be people who say eight o'clock in Lungmen is for the eight o'clock sitcoms, but Hung knows what eight o'clock is truly for—the little round dining table, with his folks sat huddled in a circle.",

If you don't rest, I'll MAKE you rest, I'm warning you!'\nSavage lifts away the giant basket of carrots perched atop her mum's head.\n'Fresh, sweet, and crunchy! Just perfect for this trip's rations. I'll bring the leftover ones back, Mum, and then you can make carrot pie!'\nMum leaps up and gives Savage a few raps on the head. 'These are for you to rest up at home, and let your health come back to you!\n'Ever since you came back from that abandoned mine all a muddle, it's like your motor's never stopped.\n'If you're not banging on about how you met a ghost, then you're trying to run out of doors... Stuffing all our family plans, that's you. You've got me at wit's end.'\nShe can't possibly explain to her mother that that wasn't a ghost sighting, but on the other hand, it is true the mysterious stranger with the little rabbit hasn't left a trace for her to find.\nIt's as if whoever they were, they never existed in these lands at all.\nHow?\n'You went somewhere, suddenly passed out, then the people who were with you all vanished into thin air.\n'Ghost stories like that are a penny a piece for the workers here. That's just life in the mines.'\n'They were NOT just ghosts haunting Rim Billy!'\nEven though it was the briefest of encounters, Savage remembers the warmth of the girl curled up sleeping in her arms that evening. Moreover, when she spent every bit of her strength smashing apart boulders to rescue them from that collapsed mineshaft, the mysterious stranger clearly bled.\nThey never told her where their journey's destination lay, but when the mysterious stranger was alone, tightly wrapped in solemn silence, Savage knows she caught a glimpse of them gazing into the starry sky, and to lands far away.\nWho could be waiting for them up ahead?\nSavage doesn't know, but they need her help.\n'Mum, I'm not going to make it! I still have to go to the maintenance crew and check if they've fixed my hammer yet!'\nHer mother knows this passionate girl of hers. Ever since she was little, once she got fixated on something, she'd never let it go.\n'Oi, you forgot to empty the letterbox again, it's been more than a week now. Honestly, you make me doubt if you can take care of yourself...'\nBut that letter Savage had ignored for days is what finally calms her down. Stuffed inside is a design, drawn by hand, for a weapon just for her—and in the corner is a doodle of three people. Plus, a note.\n'Miss, pardon us for not saying goodbye. The Doctor is very sorry that you broke your weapon to help us.'\nPutting the letter away, Savage lets out a deep breath. She absolutely can't wait to hit the road again.\nA strong gut feeling tells her that in the end, they'll meet once again, and finish their journey.",

          "description": "Dear Sis,\n\nI've been looking forward to the day you wear the equipment I designed into the battlefield, ever since you became a mercenary at BSW with that giant smile on your face. Now my wish has finally come true. Do you know how happy that makes me?\nHere are some tactical gloves designed for Pioneer teams heading anywhere from Columbia to Sami, with insulating material, extra protection on the knuckles. They should do great for helping you resist the cold. I worried a lot about how they'd conduct Arts, but I don't really know much about controlling stuff as precisely as firing a gun, so maybe these gloves could interfere slightly? Whenever you reply, remember to fill me in on how they went in real combat. If you don't write me at least a full page, I'll tell Dad about how you've been ordering equipment from me on the down-low.\nYou mentioned how touching ice still makes you shake because of the brutally cold winter days you spent in Ursus, so none of the sugary stuff I'm buying you needs refrigerating. I hope this partner firm you're at now doesn't treat you too bad.\nYou always seem a little guilty about how you performed in your most recent op, like blaming yourself for not contributing enough. You might not be willing to tell me about what's happened in concrete, but I think if you're still standing on both feet at mission complete, nobody can ask you for anything more. You end up getting put through the wringer on campaigns as a merc, and even just listening to clients' stories tells me there's more than enough funny business out there. Even the most seasoned vets have some terrors carved into their memories forever, and some enemies they think they could never take down. I've even seen a guy start sobbing uncontrollably when something old came up at a meeting.\nIf you keep having all these nightmares, I just want you to know you're welcome back home anytime for some rest.\n—Take a step back, though. You chose to purchase new gear, and more etched ammo. Doesn't that say how brave you are?\n\nAlso, I'm not gonna jab at you about taking a break, but if you get hurt while wearing gear I designed, I'm gonna feel real bad about it. So get yourself in a good headspace before you run your next op, okay?",

The plastic imitation-tattoo one is her usual pick; it makes her neck look more slender. Most importantly, it's cheap—they come a literal dime a dozen.\n'Salary, y'know? I don't wanna splash salary. I have to rake that stuff in with my own poor cutesy hands.'\n'Rope, it's been ten minutes. Are you still not decided?'\n'Just gimme a tiny bit longer, pleaaase.'\n'I'm giving you ten more minutes. That's ten. Period.'\n'Gotcha!'\n'Man, I really like the other one too. Nawww. I super like it...'\nIn the box lies an exquisitely handmade leather choker, studded with limpid melee diamonds, somewhat at odds sat with the cheap and loud plastic product next to it.\nA few months ago, a fellow squad op gave Rope this choker as a present, as thanks for having her back in a desperate situation. Rope loves it. It's a treasure of hers, but never her pick. She used to loiter at the display window, making her reflection overlap with the pedestal behind the glass, and like moonlight shines on the water, this choker would sit around her neck. She'd flutter her eyes, and so would the girl in the glass, and in that moment they'd become one.\nBut unfortunately, reflections aren't forever.\n'I bet I looked way too desperate staring at it. I bet that's how she figured me out.'\n'Aw, it sucks so much. All the stuff I want but can't get, and now the only thing I get to do is daydream about it.'\n'Ugh—why'd I ever get on this pirate ship?!'\nShe dangles the choker in front of her nose, shuts her eyes and sniffs deeply at the leather's smoky scent. It's the fragrance of tar oil, picked up from its tanning phase.\n'Ahh, that's the smell of wealth—maybe I'll just wear this one for today. Then again, the leather's so soft. What if it gets scraped up?'\nRope cups the choker in her hands, and lightly rubs her cheeks against it, reveling in the sophisticated and sensual texture.\n'You're so comfy. I love you. Couldn't bear to wear you...'\n'It's been ten minutes! If you don't come out, I'm leaving you behind!'\nRope curls her lips, secretly showing her resentment at the voice nagging her from behind the door.\n'Coming!'\n'What are you even picking?'\n'I'm a girl going out! I've gotta pick out my shoes and outfit and jewelry just right.'\n'Your clothes look pretty much same as normal to me.'\n'You say that again and I'm gonna get mad.'\n'...Why aren't you wearing that choker I got you? Don't you like it?'\n'Of course I'm not. It's the good stuff. You've always gotta leave the good stuff for next time.'\n'Hrmph. I'd beg to differ.'",

Only a few days you've been here, and you think that gives you the right to go sparring with that mouthy bastard lot? How many times have I told you, take things in order!' \n'Yes.' \n'Stand here! You're not to move from this spot until I say so!' \n'Yes.' \n...... \n'Why are you still here?' \n'You had me stand here as punishment...' \n'It's alright, you've been there long enough. That'll teach you, won't it?' \n'But it's only been five minu—' \n'Shut up, you little scamp. Any more lollygagging and there's no dinner tonight for you, got it?' \n'...Yes, Master.' \n'That's a bit more like it. Yes, have this biscuit. You must be starving, aren't you?' \nI shakily took it, but didn't dare put it near my mouth, fearing the master of the house would suddenly beat me, just as the villagers did. \n\n'I've seen the report. To do so finely on your first outing... not an easy feat.' \n'Thank you for the praise, hehe.' \n'Don't be so smiles and giggles with me. I still need to ask about something. After the assignment ended in Leithanien, you spent a while longer there. What was that about?' \nI heard some information pertaining to army mobilization on the border, and with the extra time I had, once I'd applied to the authorities, I went to investigate.' \n'Do you know how sensitive the Leithanian army's nose is?' \n'But...' \n'There are no buts! Even if they approved it, I permit you not to act without permission! If this happens again, I'll have you confined!' \n'Yes, Master.' \n'I'll forgive you this time. Even if you had the luck not to run up against the army, you must be covered in scrapes, aren't you? Take my card, and get to the hospital for a checkup! Now, immediately!' \nThe master of the house always had a volatile temper. Just as this time showed, if one thing didn't suit his mood, he'd yell his head off at me. \n\n'Master, look! I'm discharged and perfectly fine, aren't I?' \n'You think coming out of hospital's the end of it? Your assignment was to draw that Ursus spy out, and I could deal with him myself. Who asked you to block his blade in my place?' \n'It was an emergency...' \n'An emergency's no excuse either! I need to teach you a proper lesson, so this mess doesn't happen next time.' \n'How are you going to teach me my lesson, then?' \n'Erm...' \n'Have you decided?' \n'Hmph, you little scamp. You never listen to a thing I say.' \n'I've always felt I'm a very obedient one, though.' \n'...Right. Look at that old tat you're wearing. You're a fourth-order knight already. How can you be so neglectful of your own appearance?! This is your allowance for the month. Take it, and go buy some new clothes! You're not allowed back until you spend every last cent of it!' \n'Master, with this much money, do you want me to be buried alive under clothes?' \nThe master of the house awkwardly cleared his throat, quickened his step, and walked off before me. The setting sun spilled across his shoulders. \n\n'Come back to Kazimierz, should you want to come back. And should you not... then do not be burdened, and go!' \n—This was the parting advice the master of the house gave to me. \nDoctor. I know you know, I was trafficked to Kazimierz before I could even remember. The village that bought me was end to end of hard servitude and beatings; even after I'd fled, I couldn't free myself from people who marked me with prices. \nBut the moment the master of the house and I met our eyes in the 'market'... \nThat was the first time fate showed me any kindness.",

          "description": "'Ah-choo... ah-choo...'\nOutside the kitchen door, everyone is wiping their noses, sneezing one after another like there's no tomorrow, even their eyes sealed shut.\nThe culprit: a pungent, choking aroma wafting from a crack in the door, inflaming everyone's nostrils, tickling their throats.\n'Ah-choo... ah-choo...'\nDespite how unbearable it is, nobody's willing to take even one step away. People are still flowing <i>into</i> the cafeteria, in fact.\n'Is—Is it ready? Is FEater still inside?'\n'*cough* *cough*... Yeah, you can hear the banging. She's probably still chopping chilis.'\n'So spicy... I—I'm almost at my limit... ah-choo!'\n'Then you'd better get out of here... *cough* *cough*...'\n'No way am I letting you jump my spot... ah-choo!'\nWith a 'crrrk,' the kitchen door swings open, and in an instant, the entire room is filled with a scent rich and stimulating. Right behind it comes FEater carrying a plate, her smile brimming with satisfaction.\n'It's done! Step on up and try it, guys. I've even added my hometown chili paste for a special touch.'\nSeeing the brilliant red pepper slices and vividly shining chili oil, the crowd craning to steal a look just a moment before is now hush-silent. They share looks of alarm at each other, each sporting their own unique expression.\n'Don't let it scare you! Sit down and try!'\n'I assume... it's going to be very spicy, FEater?'\n'Nope, not spicy at all. I just tasted it.'\n'Then I suppose I will.'\nNo sooner do the words come out than the crowd parts perfectly into two, and under the admiring attention of all, one lone operator walks up to the table, rubs her hands, and picks up a pair of chopsticks with a tremble.\n'Come on, try!'\nAs if unable to withstand FEater's expectant gaze, the operator's chopsticks chatter like teeth, with a sharp clack-clack-clack-clack. Finally, after circling above the plate a few times, they descend, carefully picking up a piece of meat not totally stuffed with peppers.\nShe lifts the chopsticks high and gives them a shake, then two, hoping the chili seeds and peppercorns will fall out of the roll of meat, and right away senses it still won't be enough, leading her to wipe it a few times against the edge of the plate. Only once it's wiped bare of all excess oil does she finally take a deep breath, and prepare to put it in her mouth.\n'Wait, give it a rinse in your glass!'\nThe prompting voice from the crowd enters her ears, and she sees the light. Her chopsticks make an about face and dunk the meat in her drinking glass, and instantly, what was clear warm water is now scarlet throughout, beads of oil floating about within.\nThe sight of the meat's original, fair color greets her. The operator sighs with palpable relief, and scarfs it down in one clean go.\n'How is it? Good?' asks FEater with a wink.\n'*cough* *cough* *cough* *cough*... Wh—Where's my water? *cough* *cough*—'\n'*glug* *glug*...'\n'Hey, isn't that the water she just...'\n'Pppffffhh—!'",

          "description": "The year she turned five, Waai Fu was taken to a study by her father. A few massive bookshelves filled the room totally full, all sorts of old books all over them, ancient records from all manner, ways and styles of martial arts. \n'Choose one, learn it. In three months, show it to me.' \nWaai Fu—still not able to read too many words—spent a while hesitating, then selected a book from the shelves caked in dust, with 'The Classic of Hung Mei Wing Chun' written on the cover. Waai Fu had no clue what kind of technique this was, or what characterized it. She simply thought it had a very nice name. \nHer father hadn't given her a single pointer, so Waai Fu had to pore over the books by herself. Yes, she didn't understand the words too well, but the phrases in there—'wicked walks vengeance heady; just employs mind and soul' and the like—flew completely over her head. But she still followed the movements in the pictures, practicing punch after punch, step after step. Assiduous, not allowing an inch of slack. \nThree months later, before her father, Waai Fu finished demonstrating the whole set of techniques, three-hundred-and-twenty-seven moves in all, flowing like nature, not a single one missed. But once her father finished watching, he furrowed his brows and sighed a rough sigh. \n'No. No good. Try again.' \nWaai Fu didn't know why, but had no alternative but to listen. \nOne year later, her father began to take Waai Fu through some simple fighting exercises. He clearly didn't give it much strength, but Waai Fu still found herself caught out again and again, and every time, her father's fists would never pull back as they landed on her. \nWaai Fu didn't understand. Clearly she knew every move by heart, but why couldn't she make fluent use of them? She decided to look within the manual again for answers, and after several times parsing from cover to cover, she finally found, in one unremarkable corner, a phrase. \n'Ways aloft may decree, but man is what makes change.' \nAnd a few more years later, Waai Fu could recite that book in her sleep, the tomes now shelved in a nook of her room, rarely flipped through anymore. In her training, too, her father came to chide her less and less, and she felt he was becoming less strict than he was before. But suddenly, her father left home. He left behind a pair of daggers, and a single phrase. \n'I must go and find something.' \nWaai Fu was unable to comprehend just what could be worth her father abandoning her, abandoning this home, to search for. It was only a few days after that Waai Fu left home too, to live somewhere different. \nWhile tidying her room, she again saw the manual, and offhandedly, flipped through it. From start to end, page by page, it was like her past lay before her. She found, at the very end of the very last tome, clearly written: 'Martiality asks mastery, this only from thorough training. With no purpose and no self, there is no boundary and no end.' \n'You're right, father. I'll catch up to you, and become stronger than you.'",

          "description": "今天的提琴课，老师似乎迟到了很长时间，但学生却并无所谓，反正她从来也不喜欢那位提琴教师。那部大提琴独奏，她明明已经能够独立完成，却总也无法让老师满意。\n自己确实没法演奏得和老师一样好。她曾经也想要沉到乐谱中去，与素未谋面的作曲家畅快对谈。可那苍白乐谱上的漆黑字迹却总是沉默。那位神秘的作曲家离世已逾百年，据说她终身孤独，除了几份乐谱孤本流传，其他生平几乎无迹可寻。她无从领悟乐章中起伏的热情和悲伤，也不知道乐谱中那“永恒的爱人”究竟是什么人物，又为什么会变得狂乱仓皇。\n于是她只能无情地执行着乐谱上的指令。一开始，她还得心应手，那些音符都还触手可及，稳当地落在她的心中。然而随着乐章的行进，音乐来到了真正汹涌澎湃的乐段，那些跳进和反复、那些华丽的颤音和倚音与她热烈相拥。它们邀请她一同狂舞，但一步一步，她的舞步却越发局促。那些粗重的强弱记号凶暴地闯入她的视野，又在下一个瞬间疾速滑向乐谱的远端。她想要抓住它们，抓住与它们相伴的灿烂时光，因此在漫长的谱线之中疲于奔命，直到琴弦的振动不再能引起情绪的激昂，取而代之的是节拍器往复的声响，咔、咔、咔、咔......孤单地在耳畔回荡，直到那些热烈的乐音不再苦苦流连，仿佛这场背叛早已经注定。\n于是在她指尖的活力也连同那些华美的乐段一起逝去，只剩节拍器的声音还在回响，咔、咔、咔、咔......这不尽然的沉默变成了分手的宣言。她心底潜藏的愤怒与绝望再也无可抑制，裹挟着泪水夺眶而出。她的视野模糊起来，只有那份苍白的乐谱就在眼前，鼓动着最后的抵抗。她抓起一支羽毛笔，把那些跳进和反复、华丽的颤音和倚音，还有粗重的强弱记号都记录在乐谱上。漆黑字迹宛如钢铁镣铐，她知道自己已经癫狂，但这是唯一的办法，将永恒的爱人束缚在自己身旁。在终止线到来之前，她的生命会同音乐一起流淌。\n就在这时，大提琴的声音戛然而止。她发现自己拿着琴弓，大提琴静静地靠在自己的怀中，琴弦没有振动，节拍器也没有发出声响，仅有自己粗重的呼吸在琴室回响。而那位萨科塔老师，戴着黑色的手套，轻抚着学生扶琴的手，话语依然温柔。\n“今天的演奏非常完美，”老师欣喜地祝贺道，“那位作曲家的生命会同她的爱一起在你的演奏中流淌。”",

The one I'm holding must have had 90% of its original volume dissolved away before its petrification.\nWhen you think of it this way, it must have been a very big chunk of wood!\nI guess... it was probably as thick as the trunk of that tree the other day?\nIn that case, maybe the whole tree was as big as the Rhine Lab headquarters building!\nWhoa, that's amazing!\nIt doesn't seem very heavy; I'll try to take it back whole. I only hope that the Ursus police at the border aren't too hard on me.\n\nSecond expedition to the endless tundra, 28 days from the closest research station on foot:\nI'm taking shelter from the snowstorm outside. It doesn't look like I'll get anywhere today, so I'll stay here and try to rest up.\nI'm all out of drones, too. If I'd kept to the plan, I would've gone back as soon as I lost one of my drones.\nIn normal circumstances, I should have theoretically been able to last a month and a half in the tundra, but the situation here is way too brutal. A month is about as long as I can make it...\nIf I don't find anything once the snowstorm calms down a little, I'll—\nHey, you guys know what I found?!\nA field of flowers right inside the cave!\nThese plants get their water and nutrients from the ice here. They don't grow very tall, but they look like they're doing very well.\nI am taking an entire plant back in a culturing jar. I'll do some preliminary analysis back at the research station, and then bring it back to Rhine Lab.\nI'll try to keep going for two more days once the storm is over, then I'll go back.\nIf I act on impulse again, it might end up killing me.\n\nSecond expedition to the endless tundra, 30 days from the closest research station on foot:\nThere is an entire block of Originium ice crystal standing in front of me. Could be three times as tall as me!\nIt's a whole diamond shaped block, so if it wasn't for the snowstorm here, it'd be reflecting light in all directions. That'd look so cool!\nIt's a shame to just let it sit here among the pile of rocks and snow.\nI've marked down its rough location and taken a picture. I hope I'll be able to find it again next time by following the locator beacon.\nGiven the implications of the crystal being in one intact piece, I couldn't possibly have taken any samples from it. Thankfully, there are more than enough shards lying around that I can bring back to analyze. They'll last me a whole year.\nThat's the expedition's objective accomplished. Now it's time to go home!\nI wonder if I'll come across that police officer I met last time.\n\nThird expedition to the endless tundra, 15 days from the closest research station on foot:\nI'm taking a different route this time just like HQ suggested.\n15 days into this route, however, I got stopped!\nIt's an official Messenger from Ursus.\nHe told me there's a restricted military area up ahead and I shouldn't go any further.\nI showed him the expedition permit I got from the Ursus government, their confirmation of my expedition route, as well as the commission letter for me to map this area to show that I have a right to come through here.\nHe wouldn't listen and ordered me to turn back, even claiming he has the authority to cancel these documents on the spot.\nThe words he used had a really strict tone to them, but the way he said it sounded like he was just asking me to leave.\nI have a feeling that whatever lies ahead is definitely worth probing, but I also know it's not a good idea to pick a fight with a foreign official while I'm on an expedition in their territory.\nI told him I understood and gave him a pack of scalecis jerky.\nHe calmed down right away, and said he'd be willing to help me out on my way back.\nAccording to the forecast, there will probably be another huge snowstorm the next two days, so I really welcome his help.\nI may not have been able to complete my survey's objective this time, but the results I have aren't so bad.\nWhat's more, I made myself a new friend.\nThere's some black snow falling from the sky. Is there going to be a Catastrophe soon?\nI picked up a snowflake while he wasn't looking.\nI hope I'll find something interesting out of this.",

          "description": "I still remember how my first university lecture ended up with us wandering the school building.\nWe were in the classroom at first. Our professor had an amazing reputation, so there we were, waiting for him to enter, introduce himself, and begin teaching—that was a 'class' as we knew it.\nBut once our 'professor' came in, he told us to pack our stuff and follow him. All the students did as they were told, and I was no exception.\nThe whole way, he was telling us about the makeup of Columbia's geology, the manufacturers that made prospecting machines, and various archeological findings, but every time we arrived at a statue or a bust or the like, he'd stop to introduce the next of these historical greats and school alumni that had made outstanding contributions to Columbian expeditionary causes.\nFinally, once he'd made a full circle and brought us back to the classroom, the course's real professor decided to show up. He sent off the old guy, introduced himself to everyone, and then announced that his first class was over.\nYou should've heard my classmates whispering. Was it a prank? Was it some kind of school tradition? Some figured the old schmuck went out of his way to put it on, with all the power he had.\nNot a single person cared about anything he'd just told us.\nNot a one.\n......\nOne day, I was eating lunch by a little brook on campus when I came across the man by accident. Moreover, he seemed to recognize me from back then, and mentioned how I was taking notes so diligently.\nSo I asked him, was he a professor at the school? And his response was no.\n'I just give a little dirty money to the place,' he told me.\nIt was only then that I realized the man in front of me was on the school's Board of Governors.\nHe said he'd retired by now, handed all his property down to his children, and had nothing to do but occasionally come to the school and stroll around.\nHe asked me what I planned to do in future, and I said I was going to be a scientific explorer. 'Nice. You do that for a couple of years, then you retire as a senior consultant for some non-profit environmental org. Good plan, young lady.'\nI said I planned to remain an explorer, until I was physically unable to. It seemed the moment I finished saying that, something in his eyes lit up.\n'Then I wish you luck, explorer. Once you get results... remember to come back, you hear? Tell the next generation the story of their predecessors.'\nThen he left, just like that, and we never crossed paths again.\nBefore I actually took on this career, I thought the whole thing was just a governor giving a student some words of encouragement. However, now I totally understand the hopes, and the expectations, that those words entailed.\nNobody ever made a scientific achievement in one shot. People like to only remember talent, and attribute everything to miracle-workers.\nBut history is very, very long, and filled with all sorts of people giving everything they've got, all so one subject or another isn't forgotten and left behind.\nOur lives are finite, and the new generation's always learning from the ground up. It falls to us to keep accumulating and synthesizing, endlessly, to lay the bricks for those who follow us.\nI don't know if my findings will be enough to change this land.\nI just know that whatever I discover will be passed on to whoever comes next.\nThey won't need to fall where I fell, or bleed where I bled.\nThey can go further than I did, see further ahead.\nEven just the tiniest step can be enough to make new history.\nThat's the day I look forward to.\n—Magallan, foreword to the Instructional Soaring Dragon Drone development files",

          "description": "In the early morning, long before the staff of the Ecological Section have come to work, a figure strolls through the vivarium. The vents have just opened, and the entire place quickly fills with mist. The figure remains at ease, briskly skipping about from plant to plant, occasionally tapping at the terminal on her chest before drifting to the next. After a full round, she chucks her terminal into a meeting room with a resounding 'clack' that fades away into nothingness.\n\nBy the break of dawn, a line is already forming before a Trimounts bakery. Though most researchers care about meals only insofar as they fill stomachs and provide nutrition, inevitably a few would prefer to savor their food and drink. She is also in that line, hoping for freshly-baked bread and especially this bakery's salt-crust loaves. She glances at the queue in front of her, then at the big clock across the street. She then calculates how much longer it would take to have her fill of delicious bread...\n\nMuelsyse sits at the dresser, looking at her Dresser Flowing Shape while combing her hair.\nShe has an Ecological internal meeting to attend in half an hour, but there is nary not a hint of worry on her face.\nHer Dresser Flowing Shape acts as a mirror and follows along with her movements. Occasionally, it decides to be a bit impish and changes its posture, to the consternation of its master as she tries to put on her makeup.\nAfter tying up her hair for the day and putting on whatever jewelry she feels like, Muelsyse flings her chapstick into her pocket before giving a wave to her Dresser Flowing Shape, which reverts to a fountain.\nUpon opening the door to her room, she sees some bread atop the table, along with a salad and some water.\n\nShe enters Ecological, a gaggle of researchers surrounds her as she walks towards the meeting room. Newcomers are amazed that the director doesn't even need to glance at her notes before immediately going into presentation mode, while veterans have long since gotten used to this.\nAfter all, she <i>is</i> their director, predicting her actions is like trying to catch the wind.\nAs such, almost none of them could imagine that at this very moment—\nShe is in the vivarium, looking at a dewdrop form on the tip of a leaf.\nShe is by a fountain in a city park, feeding the fowlbeasts.\nShe is in the fountain on her dresser, where she continues to sleep.\nShe is—\n\n'I'm here, drinking coffee with you aboard Rhodes Island.\n'Pretty amazing, right?'\nAfter seeing Muelsyse cross her arms and lift her head with pride, you hurriedly agree. You've seen her impressive abilities up close, although you have noticed a few... oddities in the small details—\nYou've seen her press the wrong button on her terminal, forcing the vivarium staff to take cover from the sudden rain.\nYou've seen her curiously take a bite of the feed in the park while feeding the fowlbeasts.\nYou've even seen her draw an arc across her chin with chapstick.\nSkilled technicians controlling multiple terminals are bound to make mistakes, so it's only natural that Muelsyse would have trouble with multiple Dresser Flowing Shapes, right?\nBut when you recall the sight of her stirring the air above her coffee cup, you can't help but laugh.\nAs a result, and rightfully so, you suffer a one-two punch from Muelsyse's Dresser Flowing Shape.",

With cup cradled, he stares out at the emptiest street in gold, squints ever so slightly, and under the loop of his collar the crystals at his throat, grown distinct these recent evenings, faintly stings. \nHe remembers the ringleader, who rarely shows in person beyond giving him instruction, raising the matter with him not long ago. \nComing with praise, eager to see the day he truly joins. \nSaying, I hope you reserve nothing for this play. \n—It will be his stage alone. \nAt times, the performer feels a whisper of anxiety, source unknown. But beneath that unease pallid as the Victorian mist, it is clear to realize for him that he cannot hold back the feeling of joy. \nThis will be no ordinary play, a play like no other the traveling troupe has hitherto performed, unlike any stage he has trodden before. \nThis will be his play, and his entire life, his kismet... \n\n'Mew.' \nA black kitten appears on the street corner. Few have seen a being beautiful as it, as if a certain legend where at times they show before others as they please, a legend as if the black cat here now. \nThe performer's train of thought is broken. The uncanny fervor in his eyes dissipates, and his look relaxes, watching the cat delicately pace towards him, and he lets out a smile unawares. \nHe is in love with coming to this little town's street corner these days. On it there are few, and it is calm, and the tea is not exceptional, but a black cat does always patron it, placing golden sunsets underfoot with its perfect composure, on its leisurely stroll. \n'Meow.' \nIts tail elegantly sways, approaches his side. \nThe performer tries to reach a hand out to the black cat, and it gives an askance look, its ears shake a shiver, but it does not show immediate refusal. Thus he carefully strokes its finely sheened fur, the sunset that lingers on this kitten soaking into his fingertips. \nHis smile supplants all other mood in his vision; the performer has long since had a fine name in mind for his unusual new friend, and merely has not given it yet. \nHe has decided, if this black cat keep coming forevermore, he will ask her: would you like to walk with me?",

A heartracing, fascinating thing.\nThe audience hoped for it so—sensuously, madly, excitedly, rapturously...\nThey were drunk, doped on the stories that lead up to those deaths.\nArt, all for art.\nSo he was taught; so he held.\nAs he witnessed with his own eyes his teachers demonstrate to him such artistic deaths, one after another, so too did he experience the emotions behind those deaths.\nHe was a child of art. He knew himself, believed himself, and considered himself born unto the stage.\nAnd yet. Yet—\nThe moment he truly took the stage as the star, the moment he ushered in the very first production he owned, the moment he could truly exhibit the technique cut into every bone of his body, the moment the sharpened edge would play with grace across the artery—\nHe came to realize with open eyes his own opinion—death was simply death, no more.\nIt held no artistry. It bore no hope. Its only meaning was the passing of a life.\nIn that moment, everything changed.\nThe art once held aloft was lofty no longer. The hopes once shouldered became barbs upon his back. His teachers were no teachers now, but murderers.\nAh, indeed. Mere murderers.\nAnd he, a mere murderer too.\nThe performers upon the stage, the spectators off it, all simply murderers.\nBut in every story, murderers should receive their just desert in the end.\nThe familiar weight upon his shoulders stops his racing mind. It is the black cat. He tilts his head, and she stares right back.\nEver since they met, she has frequented his side. At times, even he knows not how the black cat manages to slip close to him.\nTo him, tonight is a night of utmost importance. And so, he asks the question.\n'Would you walk with me?'\nThe black cat licks at her paws, yawns, and seems to entirely lack interest in the question.\n'How would the name... Christine strike you?'\n'Meow.'\nThe black cat—no—Miss Christine now seems much more enthused. With a few short hops she descends from the windowsill, and turns back to glance at him. Oddly, the notion strikes him that Miss Christine is concerned for him.\n'Don't worry.'\nYes. Do not worry.\nHis decision has been ever resolute.\nThe curtain slowly opens, the spotlights hang above center stage, the seats below are packed, and all await the play with high hopes.\nTo center stage, he paces.\nFor murderers, a trial at times comes from a place of righteous anger, and at others from introspective guilt, but all are equal in their exit from the stage.\nHe clears his throat.\nTonight, death will come equal.",

Even though she came on to take treatment and aid, she can still take up the yarn as she likes. She's even started a cozy little class in the sewing room, teaching children who look forward to the future just as she does.\nIt was all curious and new for the first-time visitors. They squeezed about, reaching out to touch all the tools on the tables—a boy amongst them knocked a fabric cutter away by accident, making a slice in the cloth.\nIt panicked the children so suddenly, and without thinking they started to push at the perpetrator, who was even more frightened himself.\n'You messed up Miss Bibeak's clothes!'\n'Miss Bibeak! He did it!'\nBibeak saw the damaged cloth, but didn't even have the chance to speak before the boy, now bright red, fled the room.\nOnce Bibeak assuaged the children, she inquired where he might've gone, and after a knock and an 'Are you there?', the teary-faced boy came out of the door to his room. His head was hung low, and he held out his savings bank.\n'I put all my pocket money in this burdy bank! I'm really, really sorry for ruining your clothes, Miss Bibeak!'\nJust as all teachers should, Bibeak knelt down and softly patted him on the shoulder to console him, and the sobs from the crybaby in her embrace gradually ceased.\n\nThere's always far too much in life that runs contrary to your expectations, just like how Bibeak doesn't know what kind of design her pencil will put to paper in the coming seconds. Will it gild the lily, so to speak? Or will it change everything about what it was?\nShe accepts the savings bank, but does not break it open. She prepares to revise the style of clothing, planning to sew a shirt fit for a grown child to wear.\nOrdinary tailors would amend an unwitting mistake, but a good tailor allows it to transform into a happy accident, one nobody sees coming.\nWhen the children come to the sewing room for classes again, the boy who blundered last time has his head low, standing at the very back.\nWith a smile, Bibeak pulls him up to the table, and takes out the all-new shirt: 'I've accepted your burdy bank. Let everyone take a look, now—these are clothes made for you.'\nThe children erupt in cheers, and they shove on the lucky little boy, clearly even more excited himself.\nHis cheeks are aglow, and Bibeak knows, he'll surely cherish this present, and when he puts it on afterwards, he'll go do the right thing.\nThat's what a tailor dreams of, using needle and thread to sew fine futures and bring them to others.\nPutting wishes and hopes into dress, for every person to wear.",

          "description": "Holding his all-new staff tightly in his arms, Greyy zones out in one of Rhodes Island's hallways.\nThe staff has the smell that only newly forged metal has. It has a nice sheen, the parts are brand new, and there's no rust or signs of wear whatsoever.\nThis is the first time that he's really owned something that's completely his, something so shiny from top to bottom. There is so much that Greyy wants to say welling up in his chest, but he's unable to muster even a single word.\nThat morning, the staff at Medical smiled as they handed him some documents to take to the Doctor's office.\nWhen he arrived with the big stack of papers, he ended up with a surprise present.\nHe hasn't had the time to process why he received this present, though—perhaps it's just psychological. He certainly feels his abilities still have much room for improvement, even if the staff he's been using is more than enough for all the Arts he knows.\nUnable to contain his excitement, he runs all the way up to the deck. The sky is so blue. The breeze blows past his hair, seeping into his throat.\nGreyy goes over everything he learned in his head. His buffs up his cheeks. His hands aren't trembling the slightest, even when he's holding onto the staff.\nThe Arts he learned from both his mother and the Rhodes Island instructors, as well as the knowledge he picked up while tending to the power facilities. He'll repay all this kindness in his own way—\nFrom freezing cold to blazing heat.\nFrom darkness to blinding light.\nHe gazes even further than his eyes can see, towards home.\nEven though he can't see any part of his homeland right now, he can feel the fragrance of it yet lingering in his nostrils. He even remembers how the abandoned Originium chunks felt when he touched them as a kid.\nHis light can now reach many more places, but the times when he sat with his father and mother in front of that small lamp are still some of the brightest memories he has.\nWhen the voltage of a staff's Arts Unit increases in an instant, the surge of the electric charges may as well be a reflection of the Caster's state of mind—From a state of disorder to one of order, they surge toward a common destination, in the end gathering in one spot and releasing a brilliant glow.\nOn the deck, the winds blowing from all directions brush his hair. With how vividly brilliant the sometimes introverted, timid boy looks this very moment, it's as though he himself, and not the staff, is letting out that radiant glow.",

Clenched and then opened, the palm is just big enough to hold an apple.\nShe senses the emotions of the people around the girl. If she is met with anxious fear, then the girl is met with indifference, mingled with a hint of disgust to be precise, as if that human-shaped body was never meant to belong to their kind.\n'Have you ever eaten an apple?' she asks. The girl shakes her head.\nShe herself rarely gets to eat apples, but at least she knows what they taste like. The servants occasionally bring them, leaving them at the door for her to take.\nThe girl might have only glimpsed apples from afar or heard of them in passing.\nAfter thinking for a moment, she looks at the servant accompanying her, but remains distant. She walks toward the servant, gathers her courage, and says,\n'I... want an apple.'\nNo threats, no curses, she learned to express her thoughts directly, just like everyone else.\nThe servant's eyes widen, his hand trembling, until he screams and flees.\nA few days later, a rumor spreads through the town: the girl on the island is using apples in her curses. The ninety-year-old lady of the Romano family was suddenly bedridden, or the eldest daughter of the Buccellati family couldn't find a husband. All due to malicious curses. People in town quickly hide their apples, and even objects shaped like apples, to ensure that no apple would reach that cursed island.\nShe waited a long time, but never got the apples. The disappearance of the apples showed her that she could never be like those people.\nShe is different.\n'Curse you... all of you...'\nOne day, while cleaning, a servant at the mansion stumbles upon a felt apple with nails driven deep into it. He thinks of the apples he bought a few days ago and the headaches he has been suffering. He breaks out in a cold sweat. As more and more felt apples are found throughout the mansion, a terrifying rumor sweeps through the town once more.\n'The curse falls upon anyone with apples.'\nFor a while, everyone in town abandons their apples. Crates of apples are dumped into the lake, ripe apples are thrown into the streets. Someone suggests changing the town's name to 'Nonappleton,' to unanimous approval.\nOn a pitch-black night, she sneaks to the shore and picks up an apple that floated downstream. She takes a gentle bite, the sweet juice flowing down her throat.\nThat night, she enjoys a rare good dream. She dreamed of the girl on the street eating a bright red apple.",

The doctors say it's because of overwork and so on, so I have to recuperate, and I'm not allowed to go and look after the plants. That's why I need you to take over some of the Convalescent Garden's work. I'll write what you need to do underneath, and if you're not sure about anything, you can ask Miss Lena to teach you. I'll recover as soon as I can, so I won't keep you for too long.\nBefore I introduce the work to you, please take a look to the right of this letter. There's a pouch with floral teabags, and some tasty little snacks. They're all for you, to say thank you. Go on and have them while you read below.\n\nYour daily work will involve the following:\n1. Temperature logging and warning. Each greenhouse entrance has a terminal to control the thermoregulatory equipment. You just need to check each day if the figures are normal or not, that's all. If the equipment's giving a warning, then report it to Miss Lena as soon as possible, and she'll help you solve the problem.\n2. Operating the lighting. The Garden's lighting systems are all unified under PRTS control, so you don't actually need to worry too much, but just in case it's not working properly, you'll need to operate them manually, and adjust them into the correct positions. I've drawn detailed directions on another sheet, so make sure you look over that carefully.\n3. Plant irrigation. You can leave most of the plants alone, and the greenhouse will sprinkle them at the same times each day. The schedule should be stuck to the door, so don't go inside when that's happening. There's some other flowers too, the ones in my studio, and I'm really sorry, but all I can do is ask you to take care of them for the time being. I've labelled how much water and nutritional fluid every plant needs on their pots, so keep a close eye on the markings on the spray bottle, and don't give them too much.\n......\nThat's all I wanted to tell you. Once again, thank you for finding the time in your busy schedule to help me. If you like the presents I left you, then I promise I'll make more for you once I'm back in shape.\n\n\n—Podenco",

Open it and try them on, time's a-wastin'... crap, am I spoiling the surprise? The Doctor's not gonna dock me for this, right?'\nThe Vampire engineer hastily covers her mouth, and tiptoes out of the special dormitories, winking at Reed before she shuts the door.\n'Happy holidays!'\n'Happy... holidays.'\nReed holds her parcel, fixed to the spot, unsure if her murmur succeeded in floating past the door.\nFor her, holidays are difficult to reconcile with happiness.\nIt was on the stroke of a holiday that her mother and father died. The gift they'd brought back from Londinium fell at her feet, wrapping stained with blood.\nHer sister dragged her out of the snow, pulling her hand, passing through one alley after another. Candlelight shone on window after window, but nothing lay ahead of them at all.\nWith the footfall behind them drawing closer, her sister told her to hide, finding her the darkest corner to tuck herself in, her chest burning from not even daring to breathe.\n'It's alright now, Loughshinny. Stand up.'\nThe voice of her sister returned to her side. She opened her eyes, saw the firelight creep out from a stranger's window, and it became a strange purple, and malevolent in its very look, scaring even the pitch-black night away.\nHer legs were still too weak to stand. No more did her sister hold out a hand, but went back into the glow of the blaze. She knew that if she couldn't follow, then she would be forever left behind.\nShe grit her teeth and slowly rose up, pushing back the fear and pain, chasing the figure in the firelight. Without knowing it, she ran farther and farther, becoming too but a small shadow.\nEver since, the fire never truly went out. It burned within her eyes, inside her heart, the night of every festivity.\nFive years on, her sister placed a spear in her hands.\nIn her recollections, this was her last time being given a holiday gift. Since then, the flames came to ignite at her spearpoint too.\nSlowly, she became used to the heat, to the scorching that stabbed through her body with each breath. She believed this undying flame would be with her for life, even chasing her in death.\nUntil she received this present.\nShe realizes, and it startles her. So there were people who'd still try to put water to these raging flames.\nIn every test and training thereafter, Reed puts on these gloves, and after the battle, she'll attentively clean her spear's blade according to her manuals.\nShe hasn't told Closure that in actuality, there exists no reagent nor material that can cool a Draco's flames.\nAfter all, when she touched this gift, she truly did feel a long-lost, refreshing chill.",

A current pulls at her, trying to drag her into the ocean's depths. \nSkadi does not resist. \nGradually, the light fades from her vision, the environment around her becomes pitch-dark, and the pressure around her continuously increases. The only information about her environment reaches her through the water's flow and echoed sounds. \nBut, it makes Skadi feel at ease. It is the environment she is most familiar with. When she goes on missions with her companions as an Abyssal Hunter, she slaughters the Seaborn in waters like these, and returns to that city sitting on the sea. \nBut right now, only icy water surrounds her. \nShe begins to feel lonely. \n...... \nShe is about to arrive at the sea floor, where an underwater city flickers into view. \nOnce upon a time, these Ægir technological marvels could illuminate the bottom. But in today's memories, this city-cluster still emits a radiant glow. \nBut... \nAt some point, the city became both distant and unfamiliar. \nSkadi belongs to the sea, but she does not belong there. \nShe falls onto the sea floor, motionless. \nShe is lonely. \n...... \nA song suddenly sounds out through the sea. \nA song of nature without words, without emotions. \nShe hears it. \nThe surrounding 'creatures' follow the sound and approach––\nThey grow more numerous. Yet more numerous. \nIn the Ægir's shattered light, they appear–– \nSea Terrors, Seaborn, and the unparalleled Behemoths of the sea. \nAlmost reflexively, Skadi stands up, the Ægir greatsword appearing in her hand. \nAfter grasping the current's flow around her, she charges at the swarm of monsters in front of her. Several vague shadows accompany her in her charge forward. They are clad in outfits similar to Skadi's, and wield Behemoth-slaying weapons. \nAt that moment, Skadi feels–– \nSnap! \nSkadi wakes up. She is lying on a bed, with medical equipment around her still running. \nA Rhodes Island psychiatric operator is staring at the readings on the device, the hand that had produced that snap still suspended in midair, the other hand continuing to jot down notes. \n'How do you feel right now, Operator Skadi?' \n'I feel–– \nVery good.'",

The air moist, too moist, so much so that it bears her with ease. A mere reach, a wave of the hand, and her body floats up, weightless. People, so many people, arms spread wide, roaming through the night, freed and at peace.\nSkadi does not swim into the sky. She is sat on the shore, silently watching the scene before her, gentle waves at times caressing her boots. Her sword, ever her companion, rests by her side. On the other, there sits a girl dressed in a red dancer's dress. She wears a broad hat, behind which Skadi cannot see her face. She has hair as soft and white as her own, and so Skadi feels she is close, familiar. Like any other dream, this one has no beginning. By the time she realizes she's dreaming, she is already sitting there.\nThe girl in red speaks. 'Are you a hunter?' she asks, voice ineffable and captivating.\n'Yes.'\n'Do you like to hunt?'\n'I can't say I like it. But terrifying creatures are always threatening my kin. Someone has to fight them.'\n'To defend your kin's lives, you must hunt other races?'\n'Possibly. Maybe.'\n'But then, why can we not all become kin?' the girl asks, sincere.\n'Is everyone kin, where you are?' Skadi replies.\nThe girl seems to ponder carefully for a while, then nods.\n'We don't need to hunt each other, in the place I am.'\n'Then what do you normally do?'\n'I do nothing. I sing.'\n'It sounds like your home is more peaceful than mine.'\n'It is just as you see now.'\nThe girl extends a slender finger, pointing far away. At the edge of vision, the line separating sea from sky is given a formless end. All life blends together, no difference, no distance.\n'Goodbye. I have to go.' Skadi takes her sword and stands.\n'Are you going to hunt?'\n'I have to wake up. Once I do, yes. I'll carry on hunting.'\n'I hope that one day, you can be free of this destiny.'\n'If possible.'\n......\nWhen Skadi dreamt this dream, she had not yet left Ægir. And like many other dreams, it became a fragment of a memory, buried deep in a corner of the waves of her mind. And when she dresses in that red dancer's dress in Sal Viento, that memory remains silent.\n'Now I look nothing like a hunter.' Skadi stares at herself in the mirror, murmuring.\n'Who are you, right now?'",

I took my rage out on the prisoners around me, and even the guards. I once treated these chains and spikes as weapons.\nThey've hurt so many others in my name, and I in turn have received plenty of wounds of my own. But my fury never diminished, not even the slightest bit. All I could feel was it burning ever brighter, ever fiercer.\nUntil one time I awoke from being beaten into unconsciousness, and the doctor treating me said that she felt I was a very weak man.\nI thanked her from the bottom of my heart.\nSince that day, I began to show restraint. These chains and spikes were no longer used to harm others, but instead to defend myself, as well as those who could not defend themselves.\nI began to earn the respect of others, even gaining some small amount of freedom within that prison. But I was the only one who knew that my burning rage had not yet flickered out. It had simply stopped growing. It continued to torment me in the dead of night.\nHowever, it was only because of this that I felt I was able to walk forwards, and the meaning of these chains and spikes gradually changed once again, becoming the means I used to keep myself in check.\nAfterwards, these restraints of mine followed me to a pharmaceutical company. There, I still habitually wore them, but they had become nothing more than a set of work-out equipment. There were even people there who thought they looked stylish, and learned to make their own for fashion.\nIt was there that I spent an indescribably beautiful period of my life. However, once news of my parents' deaths reached my ears, a question arose in my heart: why had I decided to restrain myself all this time?\nWas it for that singular moment when I could finally release my rage without reservation? Or was it for a moment when I could finally let my hatred go?\nNow, with my parents dead, and those that framed them also dead, the suspicions on me have been washed clean as well.\nMy fury sputtered out, my hatred died down, and I was truly free.\nBut I was not happy. The moment the Hyde brothers died, I felt nothing, because I had no idea what to do with myself.\nHowever, once I felt the weight of these chains and spikes on my body, I suddenly came to realize—\nThese bindings are the price I paid for my freedom. They make me feel heavy, but at the same time, they make me feel alive.\nYes. I still yet live. I still have somewhere to return to. I still have things I must do.\n—A speech given by Mountain at his parents' funeral.",

          "description": "Even before the match, Zofia knew that she had a long way to go if she were to defeat the Fissure Knight, but it wasn't until she actually had to fight the Fissure Knight that she knew how fatal the gap between them was.\nShe heard that her opponent had staff who reviewed all of her previous matches and had been trained by coaches bearing the same weapon and comparable stature to her. In effect, her opponent already knows her like the back of his own hand.\nShe had also heard that the Fissure's armor was forged specifically to take on her weapon of choice in battle. Not only does this armor make it difficult for her to get a good grasp with her whislash, any attack she manages to land isn't going to hurt her opponent in any way.\nOn the other hand, the blades yielded by her opponent have both been treated to give them fine cutting abilities.\nShe used to think these were just rumors. Alas, it all turned out to be true.\nZofia is starting to get discouraged. After all, her last few matches have all resulted in her defeat.\nHow many companies are there sponsoring Fissure? Are there really tens of thousands of people racking their brains together just to figure out how to take on the Whislash Knight?\nShe needs to find a way to get herself out of this, lest she gets defeated yet again.\nDid Nearl use to fight all by herself as she is doing now?\nDid she waver and hesitate when she found herself at a disadvantage?\nShe knows the answer, and she also knows very well that she is not Nearl.\nWhen her techniques, weapons, and armor are unable to give her any advantages, the only things she has to rely on are the same things that led Nearl to victory.\nConviction and determination.\nShe starts switching up her attack patterns, even using techniques that she has not yet completely mastered.\nShe's relying more on her blade than her whislash to attack.\nNow, Zofia the Whislash has a clear objective:\nShe must confuse her opponent.\nShe must wait for her opponent to become distracted for even a second.\nShe must snatch his weapon away with her whislash.\nAnd before its threads snap, she must strike her opponent down!",

Arene takes the name of every enemy he's killed in his notebook. The Doctor had him keep a record so that he'd understand the value of life.'\n'I heard the ink he uses is a deadly toxin he concocted himself. Anyone who tries to take a look at his notebook will—'\n'I'm more inclined to believe he's hiding something shady in there, like data from human experimentation. The last time I saw him with a prisoner—'\n'If you ask me, he's just going through a rough patch in life. He's probably just keeping a diary to sort through his feelings.'\nThey speculate, they doubt, but the young man simply smiles at the various comments.\nHe sets the notebook down on his desk and flips it open.\nHe pulls out a transparent fountain, as if drawing an overly sharpened dagger, and fills it with the brightly colored ink he made himself, purported to be laced with deadly toxin\n'The voices of others are important, but it's your own answers that matter most.\n'Write down whatever you want to tell me, and yourself, the most.'\nGuns that have killed, poison with a deceiving aroma, blurry voices, the cruelty and malice inexorably hidden deep within... Many things cross his mind.\nWhen his senses return to him, he realizes that the tip of the pen has punctured the page again, the brightly-colored ink seeping into the snow-white paper like the bloodied, grasping limbs of enemies, until everything contorts into a bottomless vortex.\nArene lets out a chuckle and casually tears out the besmirched sheet of paper.\nHe then closes the notebook and stashes it back in his pocket.",

Starting today, I will teach you how to make finballs.' \n'One makes a finball the same way one makes a man, and do you know what the most important thing is?' \n'It's––' \n'Slow and steady, one step at a time!' \n'But you said the most important thing was to never lie, cheat, or steal...' \n'There are many principles required to make a man, and you would do well to remember them all!' \n'When I make finballs, I have to do every single step starting from the slaughter. So, in order to learn how to make finballs, you must also learn how to use a knife.' Uncle Tung pauses for a moment, as if sensing that the words he wanted to impart are too difficult to articulate. He squeezes out the sentence, 'I'll demonstrate one more time, watch carefully.' \nUncle Tung takes out a rolled leather bag and spreads it across the table. A row of dazzling knives reflect a blinding light. He retrieves a lively finfish from the water tank and slaps it a few times against the chopping board, its movements soon ceasing. He then takes out knives of different shapes and sizes and in turn, removes the scales with a small knife and slices open the belly with a large knife, each step orderly and neat. He shakes the complete finfish around in his hand a few times, and it turns into several different parts, neatly placed upon the table. \n'It seems complicated, and that's because it is. I'll tell you the principle behind using a knife - practice makes perfect.' \nI follow Uncle Tung's example and learn from him. I learn to slaughter the finfish, then how to make filling, then finally how to make soup. Uncle Tung calls me a fast learner, and it doesn't take me very long to join him at the stand. \nOne day, a few people come to eat finballs and order a whole lot of them. They get up and turn to leave without paying. \nUncle Tung has always allowed credit, but I know these guys and I know they aren't going to pay. Angered, I decide to teach them a lesson, but Uncle Tung rushes over and steps between me and them. \n'It's just a few finballs, just a few coins. All you have to do is remember to make up for it next time. There's always next time.' \nI had no choice but to give up, but that makes the punks even bolder. One of them shouts: \n'You filthy hawkers, clutching books all day. Think you're all high-and-mighty or something?' \nUncle Tung turns around to face them. I can't see the expression on his face, but the punks look like they’re staring straight into hell itself. They half-run, half-crawl over each other as they scramble away. \nThat night, Uncle Tung gives me that set of knives. \n'Make sure you take care of these. They might look old, but they're not cheap.' \n'Let me tell you another principle for how you use knives. The most important thing is to hide how sharp they are.'",

But now, we know the address of your workplace. \nHappy birthday, my dear Grace. \nInside this package is my present to you, a toolbag. \nWhen I was young, I always wanted to venture far away, so I asked a famous craftsman in Londinium to make this toolbag. It's very durable, and can hold a lot of things. \nBut after that, I returned to the life that my parents planned out for me, so I never had a chance to use it. \nEven though this world has many ways of stopping a person in her tracks, I believe that you can go further than me. \nYour father is very disappointed in himself. He wants to go to Rhodes Island to look for you, but doesn't know how to face you, nor does he know how to deal with what would come next. If you ever see him, I hope you two can sit down and talk things through. \nMy daughter, no matter what happens, I will always support your decisions and your dreams. \nIf Henry disagrees with you, then I'll talk him into it. \nOne last thing: Your father found someone to make a whole bunch of those sweets you used to love as a kid, even though he was also the one who forbade you from having them... If they show up in the mail, don't eat them all at once! \n \n––Beatrix Arizona \n \n \nGrace, I made a trip to Rhodes Island. Your coworker said you were out in the field, in some dangerous place no less. Something about being a battlefield medic for Rhodes Island. \nThe way I understand things is, Rhodes Island might be one of the best places in this world, but if you stay here, you should behave like a patient rather than running amok like you are now. \nWe can afford the cost of your treatment, but we can't afford to lose you a second time. \nI've brought you some food and supplies. Some of it's perishable, so don't forget to eat it. \nIf you ever need anything, just let me know. \nBeatrix wants me to sit down and have a good talk with you, so I'll come back next month. \nAlso, your mother wants to hear back from you more often. \nThe desk drawer in your dorm was broken, so I repaired it. Try not to stuff too many things in there. \n\n––Henry Arizona",

Worried because you just can't figure out how to stuff that fluffy tail inside your suit?\n'You can trust the OF-6D Multifunction Protective Suit, the professional's first choice!\n'Sharp tapers, towering ears, soft plumage—thanks to the OF-6D's adjustable helmet, you'll always have a comfortable, perfect fit! Special protective horn sheaths designed for Forte, Caprinae, Elafia and more races besides will keep your beloved horns insulated while looking and feeling as good as ever!\n'Whether running rescues or escapes at the scene of a fire, we know the tail is another big concern, but have no fear! With the highly customized tail module, your tail has all the room it needs to flex inside your suit, while still coming out as shiny and fluffy as it went in! Hate squashing it up to your skin and pulling out a felt mat? No more!\n......\n'What, ad got you hooked?'\n'A little.'\n'But you're an Ægir.'\n'Shut it. I'm thinking of Shaw.'\nThey come to a complete stop outside the emporium door.\n'How did Shaw handle her tail again? I think her height only fit our smallest size, but her tail needs the biggest one, if I remember right.'\n'For ordinary jobs, she leaves it hanging out of her suit. For heading into fires, she always wears a size up and wraps her tail around her waist.'\n'Right, right, that's what I mean. I was busy somewhere else when that fire hit a few days ago, but the reports said there was a gap on the scene so narrow only someone short as Shaw could fit through.'\n'Don't bring that up. Coiling your tail bloats the suit too much. Shaw went straight in with her tail out because there wasn't enough time. We rescued the people, but her tail...'\n'Wasn't she uninjured?'\n'You telling me curled hair is an injury?'\n'Sorry. I used to be totally clueless about how you saw your horns and tails and all those parts.'\n'Well, now she's applied for leave. Put two and two together.'\n'I thought she just wanted to chill out for a few days while there were less fires.'\n'Dude!'\nAfter a moment of silence, the two share a glance, and enter the shop in coincidental unison.",

Don't tell me you're no longer curious.'\n'Fine... I am, but this feels sketchy...'\n'Then why don't you go touch it yourself and come back and tell us what that thing on his halo is?!'\n'...Forget it. I could never do something like that, not with that poker face of his.'\n'Which is why I'm guessing it's some sort of emotional amplifier or something.'\n'Don't be ridiculous. You don't really believe people can hang things on their halo, do you?'\n'My neighbor's cousin's classmate, who works in a psych ward, said it's possible to attach things to a halo now. Some new tech.'\n'That sounds a bit dubious—I read a book on psychoanalysis the other day, and it said that your halo is shaped by your inner thoughts. If you ask me, Federico probably wants to empathize with others, but he's physically unable to, which is why his halo has a 'hearing-aid' on it.'\n'Well in that case, I think his hearing-aid needs a new battery...'\n'Oh, come on. He cares more about how many bullets are left in his gun than anyone else's feelings. I'd say that thing on his halo is an indicator showing how much ammo he has left.'\n'That <i>would</i> explain how he always knows...'\n'Nonsense. I've known—uh, been around—Federico since we were young. That thing was there even before he became an executor.'\n'Are you guys crazy? Have you ever seen anyone else hanging stuff on their halo?'\n'Alright, alright, if it's really some kind of external attachment, we'll know by looking through his bag. Captain Gianna, have you found anything?'\n'It's all pretty normal—magazines, water, and... an umbrella. So he didn't stash it in his bag?'\n'I told you it's not some weird peripheral device!'\n'He's so attached to it that he won't take it off, even when he's about to be made a Saint. Is he planning to show it to His Holiness the Pope?'\n'What is who planning to show me?'\n'Y-Your Holiness?! Has the ceremony ended? Why are you here?'\n'I should be the one asking you that question. Why are two executors and a captain of the Pontifica Cohors off duty, sneaking around here with a notary apprentice?'\n'We just wanted to know what that device on Federico's halo is for!'\n'Oh, that thing? Just think of it as a height marker.'\n'A... height marker? Your Holiness, how do you know that?'\n'Of course I know. I've been watching him for over ten years. The taller he grows, the more antennas he has. At first, he had only one, and now he has several. Ah—Federico has grown quite tall.'\n'Over ten years? Did the Law choose him to be a Saint that long ago?!'\n'Saint? Of course not. Back then, Federico was just Federico.'",

          "description": "The young Oni warrior passes by this street every day, sticking to the glass of the florist's shop to see the new ikebana arrangement, before leaving satisfied. It is difficult to identify the age of an Oni, but she carries a bamboo naginata on her back, indicating that she is still a musha in training. Our florist has a secret rule: Oni are not allowed inside because their actions are uncouth, and if they are not careful, they will destroy months of the flower arrangers' efforts in the blink of an eye. We are justifiably cautious, as we never know if they might have the support of their kin from the underworld behind them.\nThere is an alley on the other side of the florist, and misbehaving students use it as a hideout. They demand money from their frail and weak classmates, throwing them to the ground or stomping on them. This Wednesday evening, I saw a little boy with a backpack run by the window with a sullen, tear-stained face and a bruised nose. On Thursday, he passed by this place with the Oni, but soon turned back alone and squirmed back into the alley. \n On Friday afternoon, I was helping the master arrange flowers when I saw people squatting along the side of the street with water pipes, wine bottles, crowbars, and the like. Before we could call the police, the person they were waiting for arrived. The Oni musha accompanied the little boy from school just like yesterday. When they got to our window, the little boy suddenly began to pick up his pace, and the teens who were bullying him quickly surrounded him. \nThey were almost ready to kill the Oni. The Oni's bamboo naginata managed to block a few blows, but was broken into several pieces by their sheer brute force. \nThen, that was the first time I saw an ‘Oni.’ \nThe Oni musha who had lost her weapon raised her fists, tearing through metal with her bare knuckles, smearing her own blood in the eyes of her opponents, lashing out with her knees and feet when her fists were blocked, striking out with her horns when her legs were restrained, biting with her teeth when her horns were blocked. When the whistle signaling the police's arrival came at last, only one was still standing – the Oni. \nShe wiped the corners of her bleeding lips emotionlessly, like the legendary man-eating fiends of lore. The people were intimidated by her silence and kept their distance to avoid her, pointing at her from behind windows and doors. \nThen, my master opened the door of the flower shop and walked out, sliding a bamboo leaf freshly-folded into an appropriate shape into the palm of her hand. \nThe young Oni warrior blinked, as if she had woken up from a nightmare, carefully closed her fist, and smiled at my master.",

Why?'\nVigna receives a puzzled stare in response.\n'Why am I going back to Kazdel now?'\n'Always comes a day Sarkaz head home again, right?'\n'Hahahahah, you're kidding, Vinny.'\nThe young Sarkaz stands up.\n'I'm a Columbian. My home's right here.'",

          "description": "I had this bizarre experience once.\nIt was when I only just found out I had Oripathy, and they kicked me out of the city. There was this Messenger who'd been sprinting to the wasteland settlement for nights on end, just to hand me a letter, so she wouldn't 'let down anyone's goodwill.'\nMaybe she noticed I was kind of out of my senses, because after I took the letter, she suddenly held her hand out at me, all serious.\n'...If you're feeling down, I have this trick to make someone relax for a little. Do you wanna give it a shot?'\nI was permanently conscious about contact after my whole Oripathy diagnosis, but she grabbed straight onto my arm.\nNext thing to hit me was how my own body had gotten lighter.\nSo light I almost couldn't feel its presence anymore, and so I couldn't feel the Originium in me either. There was light shining out of her staff, Arts glittering like fireflies and circling around us, fading in and out.\nThen I realized, we were fireflies floating in the air too. The land swayed away beneath our feet, and then I couldn't see my own shadow. All I saw was nomadic cityways stretching into the distance, the lights from all the settlements flickering like fireworks.\n'Light as a feather, right? All your worries and cares floating like dust now?'\nAlong the nomadic city streets far away, the lights strung together into lines, with the skyscrapers' shadows melting into the night. I used to hurry along their walls down in the street, and the buildings always stood there being so ice-cold and mighty, but now they seemed so insignificant, distant and innocent.\n'Deep breaths, in—out.'\nMy breathing fused with the wind. We peacefully floated in the night breeze, with the wasteland sand low below us, and all the stars in the sky felt within reach.\n'—Congratulations. You've blown the dust away,' I heard the Messenger airily say.",

The sender's face was sweet and brimmed with eagerness as she delivered it here, urging again and again to let her know straight away if there was a reply.\nAngelina gingerly left the letter on the recipient's windowsill, using a nice-looking stone to keep this kindness in place, so that it wouldn't be blown off next morning in the wind.\nHow would the recipient feel when they saw it? With a light heart, Angelina leapt down from the building.\n\nA very old box.\nSeemingly years and years old, its sender was an elderly Infected who lived in a wasteland settlement. Shaking, he wrote the address in one long string, crossing it out midway and changing it many a time, before finally, with a look of satisfaction, shutting his eyes. Quickly and nimbly, his fellow residents moved him somewhere far away, and so waited for his return to dust.\nAngelina found the address he had written, but the little cabin he'd reminisced about was no longer there. A splendorous new building stood in its place, and her gait came to a halt.\nWho did the old man want to send the box to? What was inside it? Angelina carefully placed it back into her bag, and knew she'd never know the answers to these questions now.\n\nA bag of vibrant green limes.\nAngelina had meticulously picked these fruits out at the stall, plucked off the dead leaves, wiped them clean of grime, and even sprinkled a few fine droplets over them. With no recipient, no address, and no sender, she followed her own memories and arrived in a familiar place.\nThe third house from the east end of the street.\nThe mailbox had previously received a letter with a heart drawn on it, but the husband and wife behind the door never saw the sender for themselves.\nStill, this morning, when they opened up at the knock of the door to find an veranda empty save for a few limes floating in midair, the couple knew their daughter had come by. They could've cried tears of joy, and perhaps they did.\nAngelina sprung out from behind the door, and gave them a great, big hug.",

I bring to you the brine of that place!'\nThe next to seek an audience was an alchemist, shrouded from sight and of age unknown, yet bearing a treasure he wished to present.\nBut before the king could decide whether or not to trust this figure, the alchemist appeared within his hall.\nHe asked the king to give him the hourglass and the flask, and the king readily agreed, curious as to what he would do.\nThe sand from the ends of the land melted into red liquid before his eyes.\nThe brine from the ends of the sea crystallized into white sand before his eyes.\nThe alchemist scattered them both nonchalantly, and they seemed to dissipate into thin air. As if responding to his will, a strong wind blew through the kingdom for three days and nights.\n'I know not how vast the land or the sea are, but regardless, neither are as vast as Iberia's boundless power.'\n'From now on, the winds of the land and sea obey your will, O King of Iberia.\n'Starting today, see to it that a fleet is built, and follow the direction of the wind.'\n'Be it by land or sea, Iberia's fleet shall show the way.'",

Prepare a device to freeze the edamame. I will use my own edamame box here as a demonstration: this much freezing is just right.\n3. Prepare a device to discharge electricity. I'll demonstrate with my trusty sidekick here: this much power leakage is just right.\n4. Lower the voltage of the discharge device and shock the edamame until the juice inside carries a slight charge.\n5. Eat.\n[Efficacy]\nIn the barrens, maintaining a clear mind can be a real challenge. The boundless wilderness, the sweeping dust storms, the glow reflecting from the active Originium clouds in the sky, the howl of the wind blowing through Originium crystal clusters... It's easy to gradually lose your sense of self and fall into a trance-like state where you won't notice incoming dangers.\nChew the edamame along with its shell. The hairs of the shell can stimulate the mouth, thus keeping the user's nerves active.\nFrozen edamame can stimulate the gums and make it easier to stay awake.\nThe slightly-charged juices can give a tingling jolt, thus sharpening the user's perception.\nProper stimulation can prevent people from falling into a stupor. This is the only way to survive in the wilderness.\n\n'You've put a weird amount of thought into this manual, Ayers.'\n'Quit flapping your gums, Leon. A lot of operators have been coming by the last few days, asking me for the secret to staying awake in the wilds. I'm sick of giving the same explanation again and again.'\n'I guess it's true that your manual could stop people from coming, but... to be honest, I'm surprised those hobbies of yours can actually come in handy.'\n'That's a nice bonus. Edamame is delicious, and I find the electric jolt refreshing.'\n'Well, whatever floats your boat. At first, I was worried you were forcing yourself to do all that just to stay awake protecting me...'\n'Do I seem like that kind of person?'\n'Not really. Remember the first time you ate edamame? With shell and everything? You didn't know to peel it back then and we were worried it'd cause some sort of problem, but instead you seemed happy as could be.'\n'I remember. That was when the mining ship broke down in the barrens. By the time we got it huffing and puffing to the next mine, everyone was already delirious with hunger. It was the first time I had food that could just snap you back to your senses, and it really stuck with me.'\n'Wait, so it all comes back to waking you up after all? You know, I'm starting to feel a little sorry for you, Ayers.'\n'No, it's because edamame is delicious, and I find the electric jolt refreshing.'\n'...Alright then. Whatever floats your boat.'",

Holds a firm and aggressive stance towards people of Taran background. He is on high alert, and decapitation operations are not advised.\nOn the evening of the 12th, he dined with two Messengers at the Waterside Restaurant, lip reading reveals that they were dispatched by a certain Count.\n...\nAs expected, all attempts at communication have failed. It can now be confirmed that the Oripathy crisis in County Hillock has been artificially exacerbated. Someone is stoking his hatred behind the scenes and using his stubborn and self-centered personality to test the Duke of Wellington's stance. The battle plan has taken shape, and the image contains a telegram sent to the barracks on an outlying plate.\nThis calls for a requisite disclosure of information to him in order to reduce suspicion on me from within the military apparatus.\n\nPersonnel: Count Mourning\nIntends to defect to the Duke of Wellington. His demesne is near to Londinium, and a large quantity of Originium product orders have been flowing in. Based on the volume, he has the military prowess to stand firm against the various units outside Londinium.\nHe and his wife share a love of Bolívarian coffee, taking regular trips to purchase the beans in person. His children are not yet of age, and his eldest daughter attended a private secondary school in the Auchterigg Borough of Londinium until departing last year.\nSignature and handwriting can be seen in the image.\n...\nHe is on good terms with the Skamandros family, and most of his trusted aides also have respect for the White Wolf Count. Rita may be a crucial bargaining chip. If Mandragora brings Rita with her to negotiate a collaboration, the process should go smoother. After all, he would not want to see anything happen to his friend's daughter. Time is limited, we will need to push him to make a decision and agree to help Dublinn infiltrate Londinium.\n\nOrganization: 'Rhodes Island'\nThe medical organization that made off with Loughshinny. They're registered in Victoria and have four drug patents pertaining to Oripathy.\n...\n\n'The remaining pages are all about you, so you've no need to scrutinize them any further, right?'\n'I've been at it for nearly a year now, and this is the only information I've gathered. I have to compliment your clandestine work.'\n'The intelligence I'm offering you is only the lovingly curated fraction that is beneficial to the both of us. Whether or not I've fabricated anything is up to you to determine.'\n'...Come now, have I not been sufficiently pacifist in my methods?'\n'After all, I've never picked anyone out as an enemy, and I don't particularly enjoy seeing people sacrifice themselves.'\n'I just like to push people in the right direction and listen as those contradictory bits form their own harmony.'",

          "description": "Based on my grasp of the situation, the Originium crystals present on the Infected by all rights shouldn't be active. The professor and student mentors haven't shown any symptoms—which is to say, ordinary contact with an Infected, and even treatment of them, likely doesn't lead to infection at all.\nWhich lets me confirm that I was only infected because I made contact with Originium while it was in an active state.\nAs for the active Originium's origins: Was this region already polluted by Originium?—Unlikely, because the professor and student mentors weren't infected. Was it my contact with Infected blood?—Not impossible.\nI can be sure that Infected blood carries traces of active Originium. If so, I need to distinguish whether the areas I contacted at the time were open wounds, how long the contact lasted, the freshness of contacted blood, etc. For all factors.\nIf there was a wound, fresh blood was contacted, and contact was prolonged, I can hypothesize resultant infection was inevitable; if there was a wound, stale blood was contacted, and contact was brief, would infection occur? This can determine whether or not Originium activity in the blood of Infected wanes as time passes. Also, if there was no wound and fresh blood was contacted; if there was no wound, stale blood was contacted...\nUnfortunately, I don't remember the exact circumstances. Actually, I don't even know how I was infected. I was too busy...\nBut I do remember that before I discovered Originium crystals on my body, I had a fever, headaches, and other symptoms. Right, I was under the impression for a few days that I'd fallen ill from overwork. Now I see it must have been a sort of initial onset of the Oripathy infection. I often hear patients give similar accounts of their own circumstances during diagnosis.\nPlus, given a view informed by the critical care of Infected over the past days, my own condition is relatively mild, but I can't be sure of anything without further tests.\nThat's the best summary I can give for now. If I think of anything else later, I'll add it here.\nThe professor and mentors are staying here to continue their assignments. Aside from providing some practical accounts of Infected life from the perspective of a doctor, I'm not much help anymore. I'm currently searching for a medical organization that specializes in researching and treating Oripathy. As volunteers in the face of this still-unknown disease, we can't provide very effective care to those who need it most, and there may even be further infections down the line. We need more specialized, in-depth research before we can confront this sickness.\nWould such an organization exist?\n—Sussurro's diary entry following Oripathy diagnosis",

She'd never had the finest control over firearms, though the Sankta her age used guns as naturally as their own limbs.\n'Fia. I'm not going to say 'it's just a racial gulf' or whatever to try to comfort you, and I'm not going to proclaim that wielding guns is a Sankta-exclusive glory, like SOME cardinals. Practice will yield results, and you've as good as brushed shoulders with those results, even if it's not gone how you'd want.'\n'But there's still a different way, or maybe you could say a different TOOL that could help you move forward. This box holds something one of my mechanics tutors left to me. He's not coming back to Laterano, ever. He violated the law.'\n'But, child, law is not our everything. Now don't look at me like that—yes, you might go 'big whoop,' but nobody would say our everything ends at food and water either, right? They're just things we're forced to rely on to survive. There's always something that transcends the law, sits beyond it, and everyone has a different idea of what it is. Some call it righteousness, some call it sensibility, and some call it a vague hope.'\n'Don't panic, and don't worry. There will be times when wanting to do something will make you unstoppable.'\n......\nThe Liberi is no longer a girl; she's been more places than can be imagined, and seen more sights than can be believed, but afternoons in Laterano will never change. The sun is as fine and beautiful as ever.\nThese two weapons have been by her side for longer than can be described; they have ensured her safety through danger, and mercilessly shot down the absurd aspirations of others.\nShe carefully cleans the grime from her old friends, oils them, inspects the pressure in every last piece of ammo, and affirms again and again their ordering by type. She'll soon face her pursuer, her enemy of eight years, and there's no such thing as being overly prepared.\nThere is always something that transcends the law.\nThere's no vengeance in her heart, and no pity either. Only this: what must be settled will be settled, and those who must bear the cost will pay the price. She understands—this is an obsession, nothing more.\nShe slots the final shell into her magazine.",

          "description": "'Relax for once, Fiammetta. Look on the bright side... next time, we can report to Lemuen about our work.'\nVelliv's poring closely over the papers, but tosses the remark out anyway, like she can read her mind. Fiammetta sighs—this is what she hates about Velliv. The Sankta get in on each other's emotions thanks to their empathy, and she's no Sankta, but she's never felt like Velliv couldn't see straight through her anyway.\nVelliv abruptly lifts her head, as if some thought has struck, and looks at her.\n'Speaking of which, Fiammetta, now's your chance.'\n'What?'\n'At independence.'\n'......'\n'The team you and Mostima had going was a real exception, organizationally speaking—basically a custom set-up just for you two, not much flexibility. But now that Lemuen's joining, we've gotta shake up how it's structured. Perfect opportunity.'\nVelliv interlaces her fingers, props her chin up, and throws her a sunny grin.\n'Who's saying this? Her? Lemuen? His Holiness? Or is it just you?'\n'I'm not the type to stick my neck out. But it's not something I <i>haven't</i> thought about, you know.' She stoops down to pull a document out from the cupboard by her foot, which Fiammetta knows at a glance is the file on Andoain. 'After the incident at the Summit of Nations, they upped the risk level on Andoain a notch. If there was any hunter out there willing to devote her heart and soul to catching him, I'd sleep better at night for it.'\n'Sometimes, I wish other Laterans would care for Laterano as much as you do.' It's not a lie. Even on the work front, Fiammetta considers Velliv an admirable example.\n'So, what do you say?'\n'I refuse.'\n'Why? There's way more efficient ways to capture Andoain than working alongside Mostima, you know that.'\n'It's because Mostima's worse.'\n'Worse as in... Andoain's always gonna be there, but Mostima's the woman who might just vanish without a trace one day?'\n'No. I haven't heard her actually speak her mind even once since His Holiness gave her her mission. I don't care if it feels like I'm the only idiot still clinging to the whole Andoain thing, and I don't blame her or Lemuen for having other ideas. <i>But,</i>' and she speaks that 'but' like she tore it off and spat it out, 'whatever she saw in that staff, whatever she's thinking, whatever the hell it is Lemuen forgives or pardons Andoain for—she can tell me, Lemuen can tell me, but they have to tell me <i>something.</i> They have to tell me everything... they owe me that much.'\n'And what if they never ever tell you?'\n'I can wait. As long as I'm their friend, as long as they're my friends.'\n'I see. Well... it's looking to be a real long road, then.'\n'Way ahead of you.'",

If the mission loses anyone their belongings, you have to compensate with equal value afterwards.\nSo today, while everyone's still asleep, Cutter knocks out a mercenary guard, cracks open a crate, and holds a hand out to the little girl inside.\nShe knows mercenaries. For people like them who deal in blood, letting the goods escape doesn't just affect their reputation, it impacts their business, so they'll kill their friends, and it won't weigh on them one bit. But for the sake of this innocent girl, nothing will stop her.\nCutter conceals herself in the pitch-black night. A dull, bad sweetness emerges in her throat, reminding her of the blood that coated her under the blazing sun in times past. But the girl on her back grips Cutter's arms tight, reminiscent of that day years ago, when she herself gripped tight onto those machetes with no owner.\nShe pushes the girl up on her back, adjusting positions, freeing herself up.\nIn the interval where her taut nerves relax, the aches on her body come with—Cutter uses the moonlight to inspect their wounds on her. A bolt shot at them hours earlier cut her shoulder and the girl's arm, the blood of the two congealed together. In this moment, thanks to the movement, fresh blood finds a way to well from her shoulder again.\nCutter tilts her head to look, her mind beginning to ring thanks to this trouble from nowhere.\nThe rope that fate bound around her neck suddenly tightens, and Cutter begins to feel this instant that her very breathing is beginning to freeze. Her hands turn cold in an instant, her heart pounding in her ears with every pulse, and she feels this darkness will drown her.\nCutter stares in shock, rooted to the ground, the cut on her shoulder smoldering red.",

          "description": "Ambriel received a mission today. \nA mission it might be, but in reality, it's more like a small request. \nOf course, as the request came from Beanstalk, the reward was enough to make anyone's heart waver: an exquisitely-crafted wooden music box bearing a flowering tree. As soon as she saw that music box, Ambriel thought to herself, there's nobody in this world who wouldn't be charmed by it.\n'Please help me! While I was transporting the little metal crabs, two of them got lost! They're very important to me, so please, I'm begging you!' \nWhen Ambriel went to the location indicated by Beanstalk and set up her equipment, she couldn't help but to think to herself, she never imagined she'd be out in the wilderness trying to catch metal crabs. \n'What the heck even is my job...' \n.......\n Well, whatever. Catching crabs might even be fun. All the infected wild metal crabs I've seen in the past were ugly and troublesome, but I've never seen Miss Beanstalk's crabs before. Maybe they're cute. \nInexplicable thoughts ran through Ambriel's head. \nBut the cute little crabs were not today's main agenda. \nAmbriel activated the equipment around her – the sooner she finished the mission, the sooner she'd get her hands on that wonderful music box. \nShe switched on the power, flipped the switch, adjusted the angle, entered the data, and confirmed her target's information... \nBut there was a problem. The radar appeared to be broken. \nBe it the gibberish on the data output display or the smoking battery, everything was telling her the same bad news. \nIf she had to go back to repair the radar, then she definitely would not be able to complete the mission today, and the music box... She definitely didn't want that... \n...... \n'Ohhhh! I have spare parts here!' \nAmbriel's sudden yelp echoed through the wilderness as she excitedly opened a pack of equipment. Her mood was so good she even broke out into a little hum, finishing the repairs in no time at all and returning to her original mental state. \nAfter re-adjusting the equipment, Ambriel would set up the transceiver and begin releasing her Originium Arts–– \nHmm... This reminds me of tracking down those classmates when they were playing hooky. Now, little crabs, where are you......' \n...... \nA few hours later, the pink-haired Sankta returned to Beanstalk with a breeder box, two little metal crabs rolled up into balls inside. \nIn a box behind her were three fowlbeast eggs of different colors. \nBeanstalk got her metal crabs back, and Ambriel received the exquisite music box, so beautiful that one dared not handle it with anything more than the gentlest of touches. \n'I can't believe it.' Ambriel thought to herself while joyfully looking at the music box. 'I can't believe all that equipment ended up being so useful even off the battlefield.~' \n'Um, excuse me, were you planning on hatching those?' Beanstalk pointed to the fowlbeast eggs. 'If you want to hatch fowlbeast eggs, you'll need an incubator, and you'll have to turn them over frequently...' \n'Is it that complicated?!' \n'P-Please don't just throw them out though! You can ask Miss Vanilla... She'll be able to teach you!'",

The other operators in the lounge all heard the stifled yet clear sobs, yet are surprised to find Heavyrain, comic book in hand, buried in a sofa in the lounge's corner—and yes, in tears.\nThis unusual situation leads them to discuss in private.\n\n'Is there anything in that comic worth crying over?'\n'Dunno. I always thought that series had kinda crappy art.'\n'Then why...?'\n'Y'know, why not just ask her directly?'\n'Wait, wait! Hey, what if you end up touching a nerve?!'\n'Then what's your idea?'\n'I've got a plan.'\n\nMaybe due to having his reading time interrupted, Spot, original owner of the comic he lent Heavyrain, yawns as he gets up, walks over, and pats her on the shoulders as she continues to cry.\n'This comic's—'\nSpot speaks very, very slowly. '—MC turns into a superhuman who singlehandedly blocks cannons by the end, and none of his team die. Apparently the one who betrayed them was a double agent who couldn't tell anyone about it, and every enemy gets redemption and surrenders one by one.'\nThe emotionless Spot continues, 'After the volume you're holding, the plot just falls apart.'\n\nHeavyrain stops crying, her expression gone completely blank upon hearing spoilers far too convoluted for her turbulent emotions.\n'So... the lead protects everyone, and his friend... didn't betray him?'\nHeavyrain slowly shuts the comic.\nIt really is a sloppy plot. So sloppy and trite, her head hurts like a shield just took a whack at her brain.\n\nBut still...\nIt's a story. What's so bad about a happy ending where everyone's together?\nAnd blocking cannons singlehandedly—k-kind of sounds a bit cool.",

          "description": "Swire, Senior Superintendent of the Lungmen Police Department, is off work today, so, just as always, she goes shopping at Paci Plaza.\nAfter a six-hour shopping spree across the entire mall, she is just getting ready to go home with eight big bags in her hands and a big smile on her face. That is, until she turns the corner to a Swire branded lipstick counter.\n'The usual. Five #38 Bullets. Thanks,' Swire masterfully asks the salesperson for her favorite lipstick.\nThe #38 Bullet has been her lipstick of choice for the past ten years. Naturally, the price is of no concern to her.\n'Of course, Miss Swire. Right away,' says the salesperson, who seems to be familiar with this process herself. She asks a coworker to take over at the counter and disappears into the storeroom to look for the lipsticks the princess personally requested. Before long, she returns with a wooden carton and hands it over to Swire.\n'Please confirm this is the correct amount.'\nWithout opening the box to check its contents, Swire merely acknowledges the salesperson and looks down to fish for something in her handbag.\nAfter a good while, she takes out a mini bag. To everyone else, this probably looks more like a petite handbag.\nShe unbuckles her bag, revealing five black velvet slots inside.\nIn each of those slots is a used up #38 Bullet lipstick.\nSwire removes her used lipsticks and places them on the counter before inserting four of her newly purchased lipsticks in the slots, with the fifth one going into her pocket instead.\nWhen she notices Swire placing her bags back on her shoulders again, the salesperson's heart begins to race.\n'Miss, would you like someone to help carry your bags?'\n'Oh? No need. They are hardly heavy at all.'\n'Frightfully sorry, but are you sure...?'\n'Yes, I'm sure,' Swire answers as she walks away from the counter. It seems she really needs no help with her bags.\nShe may not need any help, but there are others who need hers.\nNot a moment after she steps out of the shopping mall's front doors, Swire hears a loud scream for help. She turns to the scream's direction to find a thief dashing away with a woman's handbag in his hands.\nIt so happens she is running right toward a superintendent of the L.G.D.\n'What a coincidence,' Swire thinks to herself.\nBy chance, she does not have her flail with her.\nIt so happens she just bought new lipstick today.\nWhat's more, there is one right in her pocket right now.\nShe decides to teach the thief a lesson he will never forget.\nSwire sets her shopping bags down, takes out her lipstick and removes the cap, breaking the seal, and waits for the thief to come closer.\nA few seconds later, everyone in the vicinity hears a thud, followed by the thief's wail as he stumbles to the ground under the L.G.D. patrol officer's roar.\n\nSeveral minutes later...\n'Good work, Missy. You're off duty, and you still caught a thief for us.' Hoshiguma, here to oversee the arrest of the thief, forces a smile as she greets Swire, the brave good Samaritan.\nNormally, Swire would personally take the man in herself for interrogation.\nHowever, she has the day off. This case isn't hers to deal with.\n'This fellow has got to have some real rotten luck to run into me today.'\n'It's not every day someone bumps into an off duty inspector when they go to snatch something.'\n'Hmph, whatever. You take him in. I'm going home. I'll deal with the case tomorrow.'\n'If you say so, Missy.'\n'Before you go, I have a question for you.'\n'What is it?'\nSwire turns around to find Hoshiguma writing something on her case report.\n'What should I write for how the suspect was taken down?'\nSwire can tell that Hoshiguma is asking for her opinion.\n'Just write down that it was lipstick. There is no need to pull punches for someone like him.'\n'Ahaha, okay then,' says Hoshiguma as she cheerfully scribbles on her report, 'The suspect was taken down by lipstick.'\n'I don't even want to head straight home anymore. Why don't you hurry and finish up with work? We'll get dinner together.'\n'Would you like me to escort you home and carry your bags for you, Missy? Haha.'\n'Oh, enough questions. Hurry up already.'\n'Okay, give me a second. I'll give the report to somebody else, then we can get dinner.'\n'Be sure to tell me how amazing this lipstick of yours is.'\n'Certainly.'\n\n'Why don't you carry my bags for me now? My hands are getting sore.'\n'Okay, okay. Be right with you.",

          "description": "Kazdel, Kazdel.\nAs they fled from Leithanien, the squad members surrounded Mudrock, their conversations always returning to Kazdel. If only we were in Kazdel, we'd have our people, we'd have food and drink, and most importantly, we'd have a place to settle. Most of the squad were Leithanian locals who had joined the Mudrock Squad there, and a few were old members who had been with her since Ursus. It used to be that most drifted between a few settlements near their homelands—taking odd jobs, or scrambling in mercenary groups to scrape up some business. Nobody had been to Kazdel before, but their homesickness for it was united in its fidelity, every bit the real thing.\nWe must cross the mountain range before dark, Mudrock told them at dawn before they set off. They crossed a rugged plains, damp vapor enveloping them, the mountains growing hazy and blotted in their shrinking sight. Heavy beads condensed upon every wild, virid blade of the sloping meadow, steeping them in mossy hues, bowing them in dejection. The weary squad trod upon weary grass, the future that faced them only more wearisome still. Beyond the mountains floated a great black cloud, a sign of the torrents to come. Rapidly, thick fog fell from the high heavens to rest between the peaks, shrouding their summits, only drops of snow-white visible—if that—in the haze. All looked to Mudrock, their silence asking her: What do we do?\nShe came to a towering cliffside, and called softly to those friends who never once spoke. As if answering in harmony, the stern rock delightfully parted by Child of Soil and Stone's request, then reformed, and all now found a simple yet comforting alcove before them.\nAs night fell, those sheltered in the cave found the rain yet to abate. Hoping their pursuers would be tarried by it too, one spoke half-jokingly—if only we were in Kazdel. I hope it'll be firm enough for us there, sturdy, just like this place our leader made for us, actually. In the stifling atmosphere, others too began to chat of their imagined Kazdel until the dead of night. The silent, wordless Mudrock placed a palm gently to the ground, feeling the faint beating of the raindrops against the soil and stone. Yes. If only it were like this.",

Do you see anything?' \n Old Lee takes out a compass from the suitcase and carries it around the room three times forward and three in reverse. He gestures with one hand, muttering some incantation. \n 'Your friend is right. That your business troubles are down to a problem with this house.' \n 'Just take a look at this room. There is no window in the east, so it lacks sunlight. The north side is suspended, making it difficult to accumulate wealth. The south faces another office building, which is an invitation of foes. But the worst thing is, there's a farmers' market to the west... Tch.' \n 'What's wrong with a farmers' market?'\n  'It reeks of death.' \n 'Indeed, it all makes sense! You are a true master!' The client leans over to Lee and looks at the compass. The disk's surface is like a mirror, a frowning face reflected within it. \n'The qi of all things heaven and earth are not in alignment. When the qi is in harmony, auspice is invited. When the qi is in disharmony, evil is invited. That this house fails to be in alignment in every direction means it is a cursed house. Stay here for too long, and I'm afraid that business aside, the owner of this house will...' \n 'Master, Master! You must help me!' \n 'Don’t panic. You are my very first client in Lungmen, and it appears that the two of us will share a bond. I'll send you an after-sale service today - if you move out within three days, I will find another place for you. I'll take care of this house for you.' \n 'Thank you so much, Master! Thank you!'  \n\n 'And that's how you rented this house for less than half its original price?' \n Later, when Lee told this story to the three youths at the dinner table, Hung clutched his belly in uproarious laughter, Aak was rolling on the floor, and Waai Fu was staring intently at the boss, as if at a swindler. \n 'Can you really get Feng Shui from a compass?' \n Lee took a sip of tea and brought out the compass, the three kids gathering around him. Reflected on its surface are three curious noggins. \n 'That guy opened a remodeling business, but all the buildings in the area were recently-built and newly furnished. Where was he going to get his business? I didn't swindle anyone.'",

          "description": "The heat is blazing, and it's mid-afternoon—the streets are deserted. Carrying a food box, Lee knocks on an unassuming ■-marked door at the Federation of Enterprises.\n'Can't you see yourself? Who acts so politely bringing someone their last meal? Hurry, get it in here.'\n'Sorry to bother you. I'm delivering your food on Mr. Lin's behest.'\n'...You? So you ARE doing his work?'\nWithout answering, Lee takes out dishes from the box, one by one, laying them out at the man's table.\n'You remember our tastes pretty damn well.'\n'Of course I do. Very peculiar tastes for Shangshuites, you boys. None of them except you like spice, and you all clamor for the regional dishes of home or nothing.'\nStaring at the table devoid of a single chili, he sighs. 'But they're all dead now.'\n'I thought you'd avoid that topic.'\n'I thought you'd know your hands aren't any cleaner.'\n'A coup's a far cry from murder. You made the choice.'\n'We're street thugs. By advising us to seize power, you gave me no other choice.'\nLee shakes his head, and brings out the final dish from the box.\nThe man's eyes light up.\n'Oh, you had Shangshu mapo tofu too—wait, wait, I don't see any red on this plate at all. This is obviously some Lungmen cook's lousy take on it. Thanks, but no thanks.'\n'I made it myself.'\nThe man skeptically picks up a piece of tofu with his chopsticks, places it in his mouth, and rolls it around. The spice promptly launches him into a coughing fit.\n'*hack*, *hack*... Masterfully done, Mr. Lee. I admit defeat.'\n'There's always a way to feed someone spice without showing it.'\n'Of course, of course. You replaced me without lifting a finger, now you're the one arm-wrestling that old rat. Trust you to have a plan for every occasion, Sir Lee. May your future always glitter gold.'\n'Forget about gold, I just want to have a peaceful day or two here in Lungmen, that's all.'\n'You think I'd believe that?'\n'You were doubtful of me from the get-go, but you still did what I said in the end—because you know that everything I say is actually true.'\n'...You read me that far, just to make your own life easier?'\n'Not just my own.'\n'Catching me means you're the lou syu's beloved guest from now on, Mr. Outsider. You can have your quiet days if you want. But 'not just my own'? What's that about?'\n'After you fall, there won't be an underworld setting Lungmen's tune anymore. Mr. Lin says he has a plan to get the rest of the troublemakers to back down from a full-blown riot, and I trust him.'\nThe man spends a long while reeling, and after that, picks up his chopsticks.\n'Go on and leave, sir. Your heart lies elsewhere—even less reason to get your hands dirty.'\n'One last thing.'\nLee flicks something out of his pocket. It lands in the man's lap.\n'What is this?'\n'Car keys. If you really want to do something good, get in the car. That's the thing about cars—once you're in one, you just naturally know where to go...\n'...Now, don't go wasting any more good meals.'",

The day he succeeded, concluded communications, and walked out that glass door, the eternal lights of the skyscrapers drew his shadow long, and it was only then that Bison realized it was late at night.\nLaterano. At the street corner where the structure above him collapsed with a boom, Bison caught a dessert that almost hit him in the head in his shock. The grand church briefly stole away his senses with its splendor under the sunlight. Soon after, he pushed the door open, where the Legati were sat to capacity inside.\nColumbia. The never-resting pioneer cities gave him a profound respect for humanity's sheer vitality, and the bleeding-edge science made him pore over every clause and turn of phrase in the contracts all the more carefully. Across from him sat several execs, and Bison was alone at the front of the desk.\nSami. He once tested his own disposition and momentarily set foot in the tundra, but unfortunately the youngster's willpower was hard-pressed to bear the might of nature. As Bison huddled in a blanket in the lodge, sipping hot water, a melodious singing voice reached his ears from outside the room. He crawled up to the window, and made a rough note of the lyrics.\nSiracusa. The sandstorm in the barrens tore the map he was holding to shreds, and Bison had to make it to his destination bar going by the lights alone. He pushed the door open, and the three Lupos inside fell silent. He coolly handed over the goods and info, and turned a blind eye to the cold glint of a firearm peeking out from under the blanket.\nYan. He's back somewhere familiar, and familiar too is the party that awaits him again as he enters. Bison recalls his surprise last time candy rained down on him from all over, but now he sees the chaos before him and simply takes the shield his redheaded mentor hands him, now in a very peculiar form indeed, making it hard to tell its original design was of his father's own style.\nHe uses the calm and coolness he's trained on the journey thus far to look as unflustered as possible, but all the charm from across the land flashes across his brain in an instant. Mixed with the music is an explanation to the rough tune of 'We were running a delivery and hit a snag, so we just grabbed it to save our hides. The mods were to make up for that.'\nBison accepts it, this present from his father, and plunging through the tunes and the scent of apple pie, he makes his way to the bar counter and begins to write a reply.\nTitle, greeting, main body. He inquires about his father's health, and writes of how his recent work has gone. He lifts his eyes to see champagne flying at the face of some unknown gang's goon, and Bison swiftly tucks the letter into his pocket and raises his shield.\nIf one day, he could take complete charge... on one hand, Bison is trying to reckon with what all these bells-and-whistles modules are even for, and on the other, his mind is looping the thought that he's going to make this place run like an orderly, regular business for just one month!\n...No, dream bigger!

She imagines it'll just enable her to walk a bit faster, stand a bit longer, give her a few more days in her life of feeling the sensation of the ground with her own two legs.\nShe's not all too clear on what kind of change it can bring into her life, but she's sure it beats a wheelchair, and it'll give her a bare minimum sort of comfort during the times she can use it—she'd like to be able to stand as long as she wishes, after all.\nFraction by fraction, she installs the exoskeleton around her legs. The ice-cold metal presses against her skin, and the straps bind her weakened leg muscles tight. She gives lifting one leg a try, against the heavy frame has her all the more unable to move her feet.\nShe's spent so long unable to run now.\n'Is this really going to do anything?'\nGlaucus whispers to herself. She's not sure; she's never touched this sort of technology before.\nA few years ago, when Glaucus learned her leg muscle atrophy was caused by a hereditary disease in her family, she still had hopes she'd be lucky, thinking how maybe it could be cured, that it was only serious for a tiny fraction of her family, and she wouldn't be so unfortunate.\nYet as the days went by, Glaucus realized nothing could prevent the gradual loss of strength in her legs, and all she could do was talk herself into accepting this, how it was bound to happen to her body sooner or later.\nBut today, abruptly, with an unwavering power, the exoskeleton braces her body. Hurriedly, Glaucus seizes on this force and stands up, nervousness overcoming her, the bloodrush as her heart violently pounds causing her to take a tiny step forward.\nThen comes a second.\nA third.\nA fourth.\nGlaucus walks through the door, this physically choking emotion surging through her head, squeezing all her reason out. She has a sudden urge to run that defies everything. Even though she still hasn't gotten a hold of her balance, she feels she's gotten a miraculous hold of everything.\nThe metal is ice-cold, steel-solid, and it braces her frail legs. She runs like the wind, runs for the endless world outside.",

          "description": "When Hildegard left Laterano to set foot on this trying journey, she received a little pouch. Inside was a small handful of the season's grains.\nIt was a tiny tradition of Landen Monastery's. Hildegard had seen her seniors off to far away lands with much the same thing. The clerics would pick out the best of the monastery's wheat, thresh it with great prudence, then dry the grains and place them into a hand-sewn pouch. They held within them Landen Monastery's fine character and glorious mission. It was said they blessed the Landen Guard in times of tribulation.\nHildegard and her senior clerics had discussed this legend's origins more than a few times. Some held that the grains could serve as emergency rations when in desperate straits, but others held their own views. Legend also told of a great Landen soldier who used the wheat he carried on his journey to brew a batch of beer, and brought a safe source of hydration and protracted merriment to villagers whose water had been polluted.\nAll told, wheat was a wonderful thing. Bread and drink, more often than not, came from it. It symbolized an enduring hope. Whether the people longed for luscious joy or a peaceful life, they would find it in these grains.\nHildegard had always held the same, too, until she passed through an ancient battlefield on her journey. The Landen Guard had faced the enemy on it some centuries ago, and she'd once read how bitter, how fierce the campaign was. She'd thought it'd be a wasteland covered by the stench of grief.\nBut no, it was now a field of wheat.\nThough a field of wheat, it seemed altogether inappropriate. The wheat growing here had no farmer to tend it. It sprang high over the plains, filling her view. It was the harvest season, and the golden ears glittered brightly in the downing sun.\nHildegard gripped the pouch in her hands. She understood. This field was born from the blessing she held in the heart of her hand. It had been nourished by blood.\nShe suddenly recalled the pet name the clerics of Landen Monastery gave these pouches. 'Seeds of Tomorrow.'\nHow would tomorrow turn out? Nobody knew. Maybe the same as ever, or maybe stained in tears of blood. But with these seeds in hand, there would be beauty in the end, sprouting from whatever became of them, even if it was watered by hardship.\nHildegard carefully stowed away the pouch of tomorrow's seeds, to grow again one day.",

          "description": "During her years of wandering, Hildegard had visited many cities across Terra and witnessed all manner of wonders. One day, she happened across a small village near Ursus, which was almost completely isolated from the outside world. The residents here had never cared about things like faith or future, working tirelessly only to fill their stomachs. But in this village, there was a young girl who knew the history of the Landen Guard and remembered the teachings of the Lateran Pope, as her grandfather had fought alongside the Landen Guard in his younger days. Although these experiences had long since turned to old memories, and the old memories simplified into bedtime stories for a little girl, their power to promote belief in salvation had not waned. In the eyes of the little girl, Hildegard's arrival fulfilled the promise of salvation in the teachings and prophecies. So, during that harsh winter, as the little girl lay dying, she implored Hildegard to give her a Lateran funeral, using her one and only precious glass bead as payment.\n\nHildegard prayed quietly for the girl, according to the teachings of the Lateran:\n'When this land disappears, so too desire disappears. But those who serve the will and purpose shall have eternal life.'\n\nSince embarking on her journey, Hildegard has been collecting stories, artifacts, and legends left by the Landen Monastery and Guard, organizing them into a notebook. It contains an old medal purchased from a destitute wanderer, a strange Sarkaz bedtime story about the Landen Guard, and even a review of cystymilk bread by a famous food critic from the Yan.\n\n'Like in a certain story my father told me when I was little, no matter how far you wander in the forest, even if you lose your way, as long as you follow the breadcrumb trail you left behind, you can always find your way home.'\n\n'But in the story, aren't the breadcrumbs eaten by a fowlbeast, leaving the boy lost in the forest forever?'\n\n'Uh... Anyway, what I mean is that as long as those who need it hold on to faith, the story will survive alongside drinking and merriment. No matter how far you've wandered, Landen Monastery will always be there if you are willing to look back. It's all worth commemorating.'\n\nThis is where Hildegard's optimism comes from. Although she has imagined several possibilities for the future of Landen Monastery, whether it is forced to close due to poor management or destroyed in the chaos of Terra, the greatest challenge is that the ideals and functions the monastery represents are no longer needed by the people, or even the Lateran. But despite such worries, and despite disappointment and setbacks time and time again, she has never stopped.\n\nThe teachings of the Lateran tell us what we see is not that which we see, it is what we do not see. It is the unseen that is eternal.\n\n'Of course, I think if we compiled the collected stories and legends about Landen Monastery into a book, we just might be able to... raise some more money!'",

According to the data stored in its program, you would at least need a cushion and an ergonomic backrest for something to qualify as a chair.\nHowever, if Scene has no qualms with this being a chair, then Lens is certainly in no position to complain.\n'How much longer?'\nScene asks in her usual, sluggish tone.\n'Only 200 meters more! We'll be there soon!'\nAlthough it had figured out what its owner was going to say long ago, out of courtesy and respect, Lens waited until Scene actually asked the question to reply.\n'Oh.'\nScene returns to her silence.\nThis morning, Scene noticed a small hill as she relaxed on Rhodes Island's top deck. Although it does not compare to Sargon's tall mountains, the path they are on has nothing but flat plains, making the unexpected mountain a sight for sore eyes for Scene.\nShe firmly believed she would be able to take photos of the most breathtaking sceneries on that hill.\nSo, driven by her impulse, she immediately had Lens take care of the paperwork and borrowed a car and a few helping hands to race to the hill. This is quite the urgent issue to her, it seems.\nAlthough there is still a ways to go before she reaches her destination, Scene has already started to think about everything:\nThe angle, the lighting, the colors, and the ratio.\nThese are questions that Scene is almost always thinking about as she goes about her everyday life.\nThis is her profession as well as her hobby.\n'We are almost there, Miss Scene. The destination is right ahead, past those rocks! But neither the cameras nor I can climb any further. I am afraid you may have to walk the rest of the way.'\n'Okay.'\nScene slowly slides down from her 'chair.'\nShe readies her camera and slowly makes her way up.\nStep by step.\nBit by bit.\nThe sunlight at last reaches her eyes, revealing the world before her—\nShe still remembers how warm the sunshine was as it lands on her cheeks and how cool the breeze was as it brushed her arms.\nShe remembers the fowlbeasts' melodies, the fragrance of the flowers, the crudeness of the rocks.\nThe greenery extends endlessly until it reaches the blue sky.\nRays of lights pierce through the clouds up above.\nScene is always working on the composition of her photos in her head.\nYet when the scenery actually opens up before her eyes, thinking only serves to distract her from the task at hand. All she has to do is chronicle the view before her faithfully.\nRaise the camera and press the shutter button.\nThat's all photography involves—\nAnd what an enjoyable experience it is.\n*Ka-chick*.",

          "description": "'Miss Iris, I... don't believe in your job.'\nWhile helping transport the children's keepsakes to Iris's dormitory, Joaquin is unable to stop himself. The instant he says it, he regrets it. But Iris isn't upset in the slightest, but instead conscientiously asks: 'Why is that?'\n'I heard a fairytale, growing up in Victoria. About a witch wandering the land, filching children's most precious things, locking them away in a castle in the woods... Of course, never to return. The collection fills the witch's empty heart, but the children carry their regret and resentment into adulthood.\nIt scared me like you wouldn't believe. All night I clutched the necklace my mother made for me for my birthday, a beautiful little pentagram. The witch never took that though. Instead, she took my mum, my dad, my entire village... Catastrophes from nowhere, flames of war that never went out... Miss Iris, there's no castle like you say, not in Victoria, not even in fairytales.'\nFinally, Joaquin asks: 'Miss Iris, did you leave anything of yours to the castle, when you were young?'\nIt's a difficult question to answer, and Joaquin knows it. It's like asking a magician if their head really does come off from their body. If little creatures really do come out of their hat. Those who create Dreamland exist detached outside of it, they don't believe in it. She could easily lie, of course, and tell you she believes.\n'It was the castle itself,' Iris says with almost no hesitation. 'I dreamt of it when I was quite young. It was grand, full of different rooms, each one filled with towering cupboards, all specially made. They could lock away time itself, and nothing would ever rot or fall apart inside... And because of that, I'd never lose anything beloved to me ever again. After I awoke, Grandmother made that castle I dreamt of into a pop-up book, and I kept it safe. Later on, she took me to the castle, and shockingly, it was exactly as both my dream and the book. And that book went into the very first shelf of the very first room. It was then that she asked me, you know, if I'd be willing to serve as the castle's master, and bring help to all the children.'\nJoaquin is sure Iris isn't lying; he's confident in his observations after being with Rhodes Island for so long. Even if what she says is so... unimaginable. She doesn't think herself a cheap conjurer—she *is* the creature in the magic trick, dwelling in the realm of fairytales. Joaquin supposes that's why the children aboard all trust her. As he speaks, his hands are still busy helping her stow away the sweetie boxes and toy models by size.\n'Sorry for bringing up something so pointless, Miss Iris.'\n'Your necklace there...'\nJoaquin looks down at the silver star nestled in his chest, now tarnished into an entirely different color over the years.\n'Mr. Joaquin, you are your own Castle.'",

The instant he turns to look in the voice's direction, he finds a crossbow bolt embedded deep into the soil, a mere inch from his feet.\n'S—Save me!' His legs go limp, and he falls to the ground.\n'If you really want to save your own life, then return what you stole.' Schwarz is stood on the rooftop, looking down on him coldly.\n'Oripathy put me out of work everywhere! I'll starve to death if I don't eat any longer!' Schwarz's eyes seem to pierce through him, and in a flash, anger overtakes him. 'You're Infected too, aren't you! Why can't you just let me go?!'\nSchwarz is silent for a moment, then gives a faint sigh. 'Because this is the only way you get to keep living. Also, if you can't find work, you can come to Rhodes Island. Give it a shot.'\nThe man is startled for a spell the moment his anger abates, already beginning to feel rueful. 'Really?' he asks, out of disbelief.\nSchwarz doesn't reply. She simply turns and leaves. She knows colleagues of hers will be there to help deal with his case.\nCome to Rhodes Island. Colleagues. She's reminded of when she'd just joined Rhodes Island, on the heels of a clash with certain others after having almost killed a target. It's almost hard for her to believe where she is now.\nRhodes Island's usual mission assignments are barely as complicated as she was braced for before she joined, but she hasn't missed people's whispers of what combat veterans like her have done before, and what they'll do again. She knows why she doesn't fall in their ranks—she joined Rhodes Island accompanying Lady Ceylon, and not out of any sort of personal belief.\nThe thing is—\nShe stops. Looks back. And sure enough, a fellow coworker is comforting the dejected youngster.\nAn Infected.\nFor the longest time, Lady Ceylon's dedication to curing Schwarz's Oripathy never really clicked with her, because she never felt her life was that important, nor did she think Oripathy was that exceptional.\nBut once she came to Rhodes Island, she realized how in a certain sense, she was honestly lucky. She'd never been treated unfairly for her own disease.\nBut no doubt, she was an Infected too.\nShe used to always accompany Lady Ceylon as she fumed, wait until she'd calmed down, and then brew her a cup of black tea. Lately, she's realized she sort of gets Lady Ceylon now.\n'Schwarz, did you catch the thief?' Just as she's barraging a local with geology questions, Ceylon sees Schwarz has come back, and waves excitedly at her.\nShe nods, and is there by Ceylon's side in just a few short leaps.\n'Schwarz, I've just heard about a group of homeless Infected banding together to attack passersby. I know we're in the field right now and it's beyond the mission's scope—could I leave it to you?'\n'Milady.'\nIt crosses her mind. Maybe I can do a little more.",

Are you still not going to kill me?!' He struggles to get back up, his shouts aimed at the one behind him, but his trembling tone bares his panic.\n'I haven't told you to stop yet. Keep moving forward.'\nIt surprises him—the answer he expects comes not from behind him, but from above.\nHe strains to look up, and the woman who gives him so much cause for fear is standing upon a thick tree trunk, the shade covering most of her face, leaving only a mouth pressed into a straight line.\nKachunk.\nHe knows. That's the sound of her loading a bolt into the groove.\nMore and more, his heart pounds like a drum, drowning out all sound in the forest, just like the thought screaming in his head louder than anything else.\nI want to live.\nHis hands push against the mud, and he throws himself out of the hole to lurch hurriedly forward, deeper into the forest. But death is tailing him, and can't be shaken. The woman looses the bowstring, and the bolt flies skimming over his scalp, leaving a wound down to the skull.\n'Aaagggh—!' he cries wretchedly into the sky.\n'Why? Why do you have to kill me?' The question is howled in misery, clutching his unstaunchable wound.\n'You're going the wrong way. You're meant to head right,' the woman icily orders, not answering his question.\nHis gasps come rapidly as he drags his staggering body in the direction the woman instructs. Very soon, he feels himself sunk still in the mire, ankles bound in place by some powerful force. The more he tries to step out, the deeper he's trapped. The mud gradually reaches his waist, and extends up towards his stomach.\n'Just do me a kindness, please, I'm begging you. I don't want to die here,' he finally croaks, unable to stifle the pain, realizing the dire situation he's facing.\nThe woman is not one bit moved from observing his twisted, shame-ridden face, and simply watches him thrash endlessly against the mud.\n'Three years ago, you ordered a group of completely unprotected child workers into a mine to excavate Originium. The vein was active, and caused an explosion in the tunnel, collapsing it. Every one of them was buried underground.\n'You must have been thinking that with such a terrifying accident, the children weren't likely to be alive, so you gave up on any rescue, and let them die on their own.\n'But there was one child, a very tough one, who used a razor to dig a tunnel to the surface with his own bare hands.\n'He dug for seven hours, without pause...'\n'I don't understand! What does that have to do with me?!' the man shouts, now breaking down.\n'Nothing. It just came to mind—I had a razor too when I was young. The only difference is, I wasn't digging dirt with it.'\nShe crouches down, and continues.\n'...I was slitting throats.\n'But there's not much difference. No matter how we used them, in the end we both relied on razors to survive.\n'Sir. I take it you're dead set on surviving too?'\nThe woman draws a hideously worn razor from her pocket, and throws it into the mire.\n'Then show me.'",

          "description": "Santalla downs the blue-burning shot in one gulp, and lets out a puff of ice-cold snowflakes.\nThe heat and power of it take her by surprise.\nIt's not the kind of alcohol they have in Sami.\nIt wasn't too long ago that she left, and she hasn't quite settled in with the people aboard Rhodes Island. If it weren't for her Oripathy flareup demanding rest, she wouldn't even have stayed here this long.\nLet alone be sitting in a bar, drinking a house cocktail.\nIn the seat next to her arrives an unwelcome patron, an Ursine.\nHe greets her in a lively manner, treating her as not one bit the outsider.\nOf course, to Santalla's ears, it's just an uncouth Ursine talking to himself.\nShe's promised not to actively assault any Ursine aboard Rhodes Island, but that doesn't mean she's happy about it.\nAnd so, in short order, the air around her plummets a few degrees.\nThe Ursine notices something, shuts his mouth, orders a grape juice, and offers to treat her to another house drink.\nShe doesn't accept.\nThe bartender serves up, and the instant the cocktail leaves his hand, the glass of flame becomes a glass of ice.\nThe Ursine withdraws the cocktail from Santalla's patch of the counter, and starts pondering how to thaw it back into a drink.\nIt's a headscratcher, for sure. Especially with the shaman next to him steadfastly focused on keeping it below freezing.\nAn ordinary encounter has become a wrestling match.\nAn Ursine who wants to break the ice, and a Feline stubbornly sealed within it.\nThey fritter away at this for a good while, to the point that all the regulars have left the bar, which itself is about to shutter for the evening.\nUltimately, the frozen drink is taken away just so the two of them will get out of there.\nThe silent battle rests, for now.\nWithout a word, Santalla moves to leave, but the 'Ursine' suddenly calls her to a stop—with a very, very familiar voice.\nIt's her very first friend aboard Rhodes Island. An operator. A Feline.\nSantalla looks back, only to find the disguise freshly removed, and a pair of Feline ears sticking out.\nShe had feigned her gender, personality, and even her race. Santalla knows this is her specialty, but she doesn't take kindly to this sort of prank.\n'So, you would've drunk it if it were me?' A cocktail gets pulled out of nowhere, blue flames dancing atop it to boot.\n'If I were an Ursine, we'd never even have become friends?\n'Does that sound like you, Santalla? You'd take all the pain you suffered at the hands of a nation, and project it onto a kindly stranger just because they've got a pair of fuzzy round ears?'\nSantalla thinks to rebuke her friend for just glossing over that entire farce, but on seeing that mop of sweat-slicked hair, it dawns on her just how she's acted all evening, and she holds her tongue.\nHer hostility is not so easily pacified, but at the same time, she <i>is</i> a reasonable person.\n'Want some?' The Feline gulps half the cocktail and belches out blue flames, then motions to pass the remaining half to Santalla.\nSantalla accepts it, and downs the rest.\nWhen she does open her mouth again, the briefest bright firelight flashes into the air.",

          "description": "The mist has not yet lifted from the mountains; still the hazy circle of the moon climbs through the sky. The moonlight is a pale and indistinct grey in the color of the fog, like a fine veil tangled about sparse branches, drawing this now-disturbed night into its cover.\nAn insect flies along with a chirp and a skitter, skirting around and around the stone lanterns' light, soon seeming to tire as it alights upon a smoothed rock.\nThe rock suddenly wrinkles, after which a hand swats at it, driving the lost insect away.\n'Oh, when is this fog going to lift—'\nA monk sits by the stone lantern, forcing his all-too-weary face into a bitter smile. One must know, see, that he ascended to pick wild fruits and bamboo shoots while it was light out, but a great mist descended out of nowhere, and left him wandering lost for a spell. Within the dense fog, he saw a vague glimmer of light, and thinking it a sign of habitation in the foothills, he followed after it only to find it was but this rough and moss-covered lantern.\nBefore he realized, the fog grew thicker. Forget the way down; now he couldn't even tell where a single step forward would land his foot. The monk could only sit and rest here for a while, accompanying the lantern until nightfall.\nAll of a sudden, he hears the clear peal of a bell. The monk rubs at his drowsy eyes, and what should he see but another faint light in the fog. Not like the one before, for this one floats straight towards him.\nThe sounds of unhurried, sure-footed steps draw near, and thereupon strands of faint blue and mottled white streamers brush by the lantern's brim. By the moonlight's glow and lantern's faint shine, the monk sees, finally, the face of his visitor.\n'You're... You're from the shrine at the summit...'\n'Spring is well on its way in the mounts. Haze settles most easily around this time. It seems you do not know this mountain.\n'You must be new, from the monastery at the foot?'\nAfter such a greeting, the monk is unsure how to respond for a spell.\n'Worry not.\n'Though I serve the gods at the summit, I would hardly stay at the shrine in my day-to-day.\n'Offering aid to those who've fallen on the mountain, and guiding the way for those lost in the mists, are closer to how I interpret such 'sacred' servitude.\n'As for why you came, and why your plight should be here, I will not pursue the question.'\nThe monk is still skeptical, but the visitor raises her staff, its streamers encompassing points of light and mist, and then after another ring of a bell, the mist scatters some. The narrow way gradually grows clear within the forest, and lifting his head to look, he faintly makes out the Hanesu that stands sentinel on the path to the summit.\n'Let us go. It is still far to the monastery at the foot.\n'Rest the night at the summit, and once day breaks and the mist dispels, I will send you back down.'",

          "description": "When a Rhodes Island squad rescued the slender Elafia girl of about eleven or twelve from slave traffickers, she did not cry nor make any noise. Nor respond to any questions pointed at her. A considerable headache for the squad's strait-laced captain, who promptly placed the child in Beeswax's care and left to pursue the fleeing slavers.\nThe captain in all his extroversion likely felt awkward about it, but Beeswax did not. Once she realized the child had no intention of speaking, she turned her attention instead to the jungle, fresh and verdant.\nAfter stepping away for a while, she happened to notice the girl staring at her horns. The two made eye contact, the girl immediately averted her gaze. They repeated this a few times, and then Beeswax moved to speak:\n'You can touch them, if you're curious.'\nThe girl's eyes opened wide.\n'I'm not lying.'\nShe hesitantly stood up, approached Beeswax, and cautiously, nervously reached her arm out, as if a timid fowl was on her hand. She gave the lightest touch.\n'So pretty...'\nSomething Beeswax had heard from many a horned or antlered operator before. It embarrassed and flustered her at first, but she learned in time to reply with a 'yours are wonderful, too,' as was polite.\nBe that so, the sight of the Elafia rescued only moments ago from slavers—soiled, undernourished, even missing a chunk from her antlers—drove a new response to her mind.\n'I can make yours just as pretty. Okay?'\nMarch's spring breeze still carried a chill. The young Elafia sat on the ground. Beeswax cleared the tangle of dirty cotton from her antlers, then took out a care kit. A gauze to wipe the stains away, then a soft brush to clean the dust out from the crevices where the bone forked.\nThe Elafia lowered her head, screwing her eyes shut, as if she were taking part in a solemn ceremony of sorts.\nOnce the cleaning was over, Beeswax took a sanding block and a small file and worked patiently at the dried-out keratin of the Elafia's antlers, before applying a layer of essential oils with due care. All done, she brought out a miniature length of ribbon from her kit, and tied a small bow upon the antler's break.\n'There we are.'\nBeeswax passed the girl a pocket mirror.\nThe girl shied from looking at first, but eventually, she stole a glance, before finally fixing her gaze on it, eyes wide open. A blush bloomed across her sapped face, beyond herself with excitement.\nBeeswax stood up and gave a stretch, before hurriedly remembering the last step had been left undone.\nShe gave her head a light rapping, and drew from her pocket a tiny, golden stone, wrapped tightly in thread. She tied it to the antler left unbroken, working the cord as she recited softly to the Elafia:\n'May the gods bless you. May you be blessed to live in neither bondage nor hunger. May you be blessed to live as do the burning sun, the storms, and the golden plains of sand, in eternal beauty and strength.'",

          "description": "After finishing her studies, on the first day at her new post, Folinic picked out a light blue cravat for herself, its color much like that of medical gloves, seemingly chosen with little hesitation. With her outfit all together and a thrice-over in the mirror, she took her papers and tools with her, off to what was now her position in the Rhodes Island Medical Department.\nIt was an uneventful day. She got seated at her workplace, met Atro and the rest of her colleagues, set up her itinerary, went to a meeting, ate lunch, wrangled all manner of IDs, confirmed the laboratory she'd be using, ate dinner, chatted with Professor Kal'tsit, and went to read in the library. That was it, sunup to sundown.\nHowever, a subtlety to Kal'tsit's actions weighed on her mind. When she looked at Folinic, her eyes seemed inadvertently drawn to her cravat. Folinic had met with Kal'tsit several times throughout the day, and almost every time she did that, as small as it was, to the point she'd thought she was wearing it wrong, and that was how Kal'tsit was opting to notify her. Yet when she got back to her dorm and stood in front of her mirror, she found the cravat still tied neat and tidily upon her chest.\nIf something was wrong, Professor Kal'tsit would've mentioned it on the spot, Folinic thought. She untied her cravat, then tied it once again.\nSo, what exactly was the issue?\nFolinic puzzled over it, and in short order took it off, only to put it back on slowly this time, once again remembering how her mother taught her to tie it—\nA choked gasp escaped her throat before she covered her mouth. Folinic was a very disciplined person, but at this very moment, she was losing control over herself.\nShe tried to hold back her voice, but managed only to sob in heavier, more broken fits, almost suffocating.\nEven standing up straight felt beyond her, and her hands could barely brace against the table before she fell to the ground, where she curled into a ball.\nRationale? Wisdom? What use were they?\nAching—weeping—these were all she had left.\nA pain that a single night could hardly quell.\nHow long must it take, until you finally move past losing family so close to you, and all the inexhaustible grief—how long until you finally forget?\n......\nAt dawn the next day, Folinic came to on the ice-cold floor. She wiped her tears dry, went to the bathroom, and ran a cold shower. As the bracing water struck her back, she planned in her head to open up more possibilities in her own work.\nJust before she left, she picked out a jet-black cravat for herself.",

Let's put on wigs, change our clothes, and slip out of the city with the acrobats.'\n'Shh, keep your voice down. You'll blow our cover!'\n'Hey, I'm serious; I've really thought this one through! We just smashed a pie right in the face of the most notorious don in Locomotiva City—and honestly, he deserved it. But we didn't have time to grab even a single coin before running. Now we're lost, and the streets are full of people ready to turn us into mincemeat. If we don't do something, we're done for.'\n'We're not lost. This is the back alley behind Baron's Pub, and there's an abandoned warehouse right across the street. We can hide there temporarily. There's even a working landline inside.' Aosta pulls a city map from his waist pouch.\n'And what is this wobbly line here?'\n'Our escape route—the one you just ran along!'\n'Broca... did you know he planned all this?!'\n'No, but it doesn't surprise me.'\n'You mentioned a landline—who are you planning to call, anyway?'\n'The guy who gave us meds last time. Our car's still with him.' As he speaks, Aosta takes out a business card from his pouch with the words 'Right Angle, Rhodes Island Operator' printed on it.\n'I could help him remodel that boring office of his as payment.'\n'We were caught off guard the last time we had to flee,' Aosta says, taking out a few coins from his pouch, 'I'm not going unprepared this time.'\n'Aosta! You said you didn't have any money for my modding supplies, but you were hiding cash! What else do you got in that pouch? Probably not anything good to eat, though. Ugh... I'm starving. Is there any meat we could roast in that abandoned warehouse?'\nAosta opens his pouch again and takes out two candies in plain packaging.\n'I'll never say you're like my mom again! But... only two? If there's one for both of us, what about you?'\n'I'm not hungry.'\n'There's that mom tone again...'\n'Shut up and eat the candy. Do I have to unwrap it for you?'\n'Alright...'\nHe tears open the candies and throws the wrappers to the ground. Chiave's expression shifts from gratitude to confusion to disgust.\n'Ugh! What is this?! It tastes awful!'\nThe white-haired Lupo, who had remained stoic and serious throughout their escape, finally breaks into a smile.\n'It's booger-flavored trick candy, to curb your appetite.' He raises a finger. 'The thugs outside have thinned out. Are you ready, you two? On the count of three, we dash for that warehouse.'",

          "description": "Earlier this week, law enforcement officials announced that the major kidnapping case that occurred earlier this weekend in Fussen Furnitureville has been cracked. All suspects are now in custody, and all hostages have been rescued and are currently receiving hospital treatment. Based on facts previously made available by the police, the syndicate responsible has been active in this state as well as our three neighbors, with a focus on hijacking and kidnapping. Seventeen cases this year alone have been linked to them, all striking panic in the populace. Working across state lines to follow developments in the case, Homeland Security employed disciplined units under a single chain of command to finally put this malicious gang behind bars. Justice has finally been served, and the citizens' lives and property safe once again.\nHowever, this week some have continued raising doubts about the police announcement, claiming that credit for the breakthrough goes to a young officer from the auxiliary forces, who is presently unnamed but has captured public attention in recent days. Following the end of the case, footage from a number of mall cameras has circulated on the intercity net. They show a young Perro female in a city police uniform but without a badge hopping onto the furniture store's roof from a nearby building, marking the start of a one woman chase—and eventually brawl—with the gangsters, lasting a whole forty minutes, and ending with her pacifying them all before law enforcement arrived bizarrely late to the scene. The young woman in the video is exceptionally athletic, making use of furniture from every room of the house to contend with the gangsters, skillfully enough to leave many wide-eyed. In the most viral clip, eight of them have her surrounded with edged and bolt-loaded weapons, then in the blink of an eye she grabs a mysterious weapon—said by the store's owner to be no more than a steel chair whose unique design struggled to sell—after which she subdues all the gangsters in short order. The public will not be forgetting her heroism any time soon.\nIn response to these inquiries, law enforcement official have stated that despite her nonstandard uniform, the woman in footage was in fact a special agent they dispatched to the precinct to secretly tail the gang, with orders to take action from within and subdue the criminals. The idea that the footage shows a 'vigilante' or 'police nonfeasance' is categorically false, and rumors that their department and the criminals were 'in cahoots' are not only utterly baseless, but 'harmful to police image.'\nIn contrast, eyewitnesses report that after singlehandedly taking down over a dozen gangsters and freeing the hostages, the mysterious young woman was promptly arrested and taken away by police. Some have even identified her as possibly the valorous officer who rescued a number of people during a major Originium safety accident last year, and exposed the former mayor's misdeeds. Law enforcement officials have yet to comment on this. We have made a request for this 'special agent' to come to our station for an interview, which the police have refused, citing her current hospitalization.",

Next to them, a distressed-looking worker anxiously mumbles to himself.\n'Peter Davis.' A doctor steps out, test results in hand. The worker whose name has now been called tensely lifts his head. The student shuts her book.\n'—Elevated BOCD, no signs of Oripathy.'\n'Ceylon Doykos. Elevated BOCD, no signs of Oripathy.'\nThe three let out a collective sigh. 'See!' the student starts to tell the other woman in excitement. 'I'm fine, Professor!'\n'More like you're lucky,' the professor replies sternly, shaking her head.\n'I've warned you two before. Outdoor investigations are to be carried out within stipulated safe regions, during designated times, and proper protective measures have to be taken. Without specialized protective gear, coming into contact with highly activated Originium is exceedingly dangerous. Moreover, we have no right to extract ore from the mines. The mines can hold you liable for anything you've done. Ceylon, you're supposed to be a model student.'\n'But I want to verify the theories I see in my textbooks... and besides, if I hadn't warned Mr. Davis and the others to halt their work, there would've been an acute infection incident. I couldn't—'\n'What if you'd judged wrong?'\nCeylon stops in her tracks. After a moment, she droops her head. 'Sorry.'\n'I'm not expelling you, but you will have to retake this course,' says Ceylon's professor says as she gets up from the bench. 'It was only your first field outing. Be mindful of properly protecting yourself in future.'\n\nOnce the professor has left, only then does the mine-worker nervously move to say a word of thanks.\n'Thank you for saving us. I don't know if we've burdened you... Your professor sounds like she thinks you did the wrong thing.'\n'No, not at all,' Ceylon replies with a smile.\n'I know what my professor thinks. She just has to teach me these things as part of the course. I need to know fear, and the worst case, and I have to weigh whether the responsibility's something I can take.'\n'It's when I learn all that that I can truly make my own choices.'",

She's withdrawn but decently polite, seems to be a well-raised young lady, but none of that's what he's really focused on.\nNo, Chiave's started noticing her because she keeps coming to the garage, but she's got nothing to fix. Not just that, but she keeps walking over to him, asking him questions about work. She struck him as the annoying sort of amateur, the kind he'd just say a few words to get off his back. Later, though, something made him change his mind about her: a customer came complaining to his boss about how Chiave installed vertical jets and sprayed graffiti on his car without permission while fixing it up, and filed it all under repair costs. The girl made herself known at that point, said she thought Chiave's mods were super sick, and even footed the compensation for him.\n'Huh, this chick's got some taste,' was Chiave's mental comment.\nOne day, she shows up in front of Chiave again, this time with a fancy cake for him. He wants to refuse her, but she says, 'I'll get fat if I eat too much cake, so I may as well give the rest to you,' pushing him to begrudgingly accept it. He's surprised to find, though, that he's had this kind of cake before, and it's his favorite. He's got a million thanks for the girl, so he decides to get her a precious gift in return, the likes of which have never been seen before. He explains his idea his buds—Broca and Aosta—and asks them to help out. Broca's naturally on planning and prototyping duty, and Aosta's not so convinced by Chiave's proposition, but reluctantly designs the exterior and gives input on some of the finer details, while Chiave himself handles the imagination bomb he's throwing down in the making of it all. Finally, after working several nights straight, the three's masterpiece of blood and sweat is ready to see the light of day.\nThe next time the girl visits the garage, everything plays out as they envisioned. With music playing that Broca put on in advance, Chiave (with some effort) presents her with the gift, and recites his speech: 'You like it? It's a jack I made especially for you! Even if you get fatter now, you can hoist yourself up into your car with this. You'll never need to worry about packing on weight again.'\nAnd since then, not once has the girl been seen at the garage again. But in the Chiave Gang's collection, there is now an unusually shaped, repainted jack, serving as an heirloom of the Chiave Gang to be forever stowed away.",

Closure ain't gonna be happy.\nSecond, pick your paint. Bright or basic, stinking or scentless, that's just your criteria. More important, coverability and absorption. If your stuff runs the moment it hits the wall, then you're going nowhere no matter how good a paint-bender you are.\nThird, exaggerating your typography...\n......\nFinally, what your graffiti IS. You don't just wanna let off steam. That doesn't DO anything, whether it's paint on a wall or violence on a crowd. It's not art just to soil something. That's not the root of graffiti. You've got to express an attitude, pass on a message... don't get too extreme, but don't ever get wimpy.'\n—Speech by Ethan on a Rhodes Island graffiti art course\n\n'That camouflaging Savra screwed up our original plans.\nYou see graffiti in the slums all too often, it's like ringworms on dermatitis patients, popping up everywhere. A commonplace oddity. So when we planned the riot there, we thought of using graffiti to pass on intel, hiding in plain sight. That Savra did his street art all the time, so we got him in on it with our codes.\nIntel exchange went smoothly. Three different works on the barbershop wall at the crossroads, and we got our time, place and method confirmed—a bombing, to put a little color into this numbed city. Everything was smooth sailing. Final word-out, final graffiti, that Savra decided he'd sneak his own little 'danger, don't hang around here' shit in the corner. Lucky someone else noticed early, covered it in black, got hands on him. Recipient aside, only people who'd even look at that whistleblowing shit on the wall were those drifters on the ground floor. He got a sudden case of conscience, wanted to warn them. Ngong gau!\nYou know how it went after that. He used his color-changing and slipped out while the brothers on guard weren't watching. But you gotta understand, the Savra was usually the biggest wimp you ever saw. Ran away at the slightest trouble. We never thought he'd have the guts to turn himself in to the L.G.D.\n......'\n—Extracts from an L.G.D. transcript of a Reunion member interrogation during a riot incident, later forwarded to Rhodes Island as certain details pertained to Ethan",

          "description": "In a gloomy jail cell, not one glimmer of light hangs about. Behind the bars, a respectably dressed gentiluomo wrinkles his brow in revulsion. In a shadowy corner sits a loud-mouthed man.\n'Signore, you got any bros?'\nHearing him utter that specific word, 'bros,' the gentiluomo haughtily pulls at his sleeve collars, and speaks boastfully.\n'My elder brother Davis, Signore Davis to you, is an important man in the Eastern region. He has many a means up his sleeve. I won't be loitering in here for long.'\n'Nice, nice. I've got a buddy too. Bet you he's also trying every trick to get me out.'\n'My brother has a lawyer who charges four thousand an hour. What does your 'bro' have?'\n'A giant drill? Plus some insanely buff arms. No joke, chiseled like a rock.'\n'Oh? And how is he going to rescue you from this place? Punching a hole in the wall?'\n'Haha, yeah, that's just his style.'\nLetting out a disdainful sneer, the gentiluomo folds his arms and silently mocks this man in his head—\n'Doesn't he know the walls here are half a meter of cement? What an utter dunce.'\nThe door creaks open, and in comes a man carrying paperwork, his leather shoes gleaming unusually brightly in the dim of the cell.\n'Signore Hengel, my pleasure. I'm your brother's attorney.'\nThe gentiluomo pats off his suit and gingerly stands.\n'Are you here to let me out?'\n'Sincere apologies, Signore Hengel, but I cannot.\n'Your brother wanted me to deliver you a message: 'Enjoying the benefits of the famiglia comes with a duty to the famiglia.''\nAt these words, the gentiluomo's eyes grow wide.\n'But it was my brother who had me do those things...'\nYet the lawyer gives him not even another glance, merely a parting remark as he turns to leave.\n'Brothers must help each other out, no, signore?'\n'Stop, wait, come back! You bastard!'\nThe gentiluomo clutches at the bars and begins to wail. The man in the corner attempts, at least, to comfort him.\n'Maybe you can come with us.'\n'Pull your head out. Your 'bro' isn't coming.\n'Everyone who lands in here, without exception, is someone their famiglia cast away.'\n'...Famiglia? It ain't anything like that. He's a buddy to me. He'll come.'\n'Enough, you moron. Even setting aside how heavy the guard is out there, this wall alone is fifty whole—'\nAn earsplitting drilling noise cuts off the gentiluomo mid-sentence. Through the wall steadily pokes out a gargantuan drill, wrecking the concrete at such speed it may as well be shredded paper.\nDust and debris is thrown down in spades, and the ground itself lightly trembles.\nA burly man steps through the yawning hole, toting the giant drill by hand. The light shining in from behind him hides his face in chiaroscuro.\nCasually turning off his handheld titan, the man turns to ask something to the dumbstruck gentiluomo.\n'Are you coming with us, signore?'",

It won't work anymore if you do.'\nShe knew what its internals were, really. It was a simple thing. Figured out with just a touch and some general knowledge.\nBut she chose to believe, and wait.\nDay, after day.\nFinally, one noon, the tremoring inside her personal pouch stopped.\nHer mom suddenly showed up behind her, and her dad was carrying a massive bag, his face filled with the gentle smile she so missed.\nPromises are something this couple never neglects.\nThe family briefly reunited on Rhodes Island, and spent several days and nights worth remembering.\nBut very quickly, they once again bid farewell.\nThis time, her father solemnly read out a prayer and opened the sealed omamori, while her mother carefully examined the watch face, and wound the pocket watch's spring.\nThey finished their parts, and soon asked Suzuran to tie the omamori's rope tight.\nThis simple, unadorned ceremony did not go on for long, but it was a concentrative, serious matter for all.\nA kannushi, an assassin, an operator.\nA father, a mother, a daughter.\nThrough this tiny omamori, the three's souls were bound together tight as could be.\nIt is respect, through which promises are kept.\nIt is trust, through which endurance is willing.\nThe land throws them far apart.\nBut love transcends space and time, granting them the power to meet again.\n'Once this omamori no longer tick-tocks, we'll be back with you.'\n'Until then, remember to go to bed on time~'\n'Mm-hm!'\n'Have a safe journey, mom, dad!'",

          "description": "Suzuran catches sight of two tense Medic operators, one wearing a hazmat suit, the other carrying a refuse bag, both at the door to the playroom waiting to strike. The chain of events isn't complicated: a damaged doll, an agitated child, a failed casting attempt, and now a toy meant to be fixed by Arts is instead skewered by a sinister Originium crystal. Suzuran passes by to see the boy hugging it, wailing, forbidding anyone from taking it away.\n'It just grew some rocks! It didn't do anything bad! It's not dangerous!'\nSuzuran once had a doll too, but a much daintier one, in a little blue coat and stuffed with fluffy musbeast fur. It, too, grew a crystal like his—and she'd just nodded off holding it when a stabbing pain pulled her violently from dreamland.\n'I saved it from the rubbish bin, I saved it! You can't throw it away again!'\nSuzuran doesn't remember that night too well, but she does remember nestling in the faint warmth of her mother's arm, and the doctor's soft, gentle voice. Nothing taken for processing, nothing thrown away. The next morning, an identical doll sat on her bed, no hint of damage.\n'Mum and Dad were like this when they got taken away! Everything gets taken away, and just buried... Why are you scared of me? Why are you scared of our stuff?!'\nSuzuran has just as little idea why. That's not how things happened in her life. But, she thinks, maybe she can get things to change to the way she recognizes. So, ignoring the Medic operators trying to stop her, Suzuran walks up to the boy, and tells him a story.\n\n'H-Hello... I don't think this doll's actually dangerous at all...'\n'Really? You think so too?'\n'Yeah. These stones are amber from another land—look, you can even see through them. The people with stones on them, in the end they bury inside those stones to sleep, just like bugs do in amber. And then when they wake up, they journey to the other land.'\n'I knew those meanies were lying to me! They didn't say anything except 'they're dead', and nobody explained. They just kept on going on about 'dead means dead,' so I think they just didn't know either!'\n'Er, I... I don't know if they know or not, but the other land is real... When people grow stones and then disappear, that means they've journeyed over there. Right now they're lying in golden lakes, basking in the nicest, warmest sunlight.'\n'Then are we going too one day?'\n'We are, but you have to go to sleep properly, because that's how the journey succeeds. See, the doll can't fall asleep right now, because it's too noisy in here. So, can you let it rest in peace?'\n\nThereafter, in the rec room there sits a doll in a glass case, with a wrinkled note stuck on the outside: On a journey, do not disturb.",

If you drink that whole ladle, all my effort today is gone to waste.'\n'Hm? Mayst thou explain?'\n'On this mountain's shone side are three thousand mu of fertile fields, and in its shade, thirty thousand qing of lakewater, but Mt. Mang stands straight in-between rising to the clouds, cragged and long, troubling even fowl to cross. The seedlings need water, so I have no choice but to draw water from the north side to irrigate the fields on the south, and I have only this single ladle to use.'\n'Hence why thou makest such arduous journeys in such unending succession? But until when wilst thou bear this ladle?'\n'Well-asked. Until when, hm...' So replied the old man as he sat down on a mountain boulder, letting out a sigh.\n\n'Ah! Then allowest me to help thee, good sir!'\n'You would?'\n'I have given it some thought, and believe what thou hast said to be wholly reasonable. Were it a spade at hand, thou wouldst find a canal to dig through Mt. Mang from north to south. Wert thou of Arts that could shift towering earth, thou wouldst employ such powers to move the mountain, and let lake and field border one another. Yet at hand thou hast but a ladle, so scooping water turn by turn beest thine only option. A task faces thee, and a tool is at thy hand—as it must be done, so one is bade to do all they can. 'Tis as such.'\n'But the fields that way are so wide one cannot gaze to their end, and the trail over Mt. Mang is so perilous and winding, one loses their way in the fog. You may be decades younger than my decrepit self, but what could you accomplish even giving the rest of your life?'\n'I seek not to be able to irrigate the fertile fields. Should I walk the mountain path once, that is one refinement of my spirit. To pour a ladleful of water is but the fortune to do so.'\n'And more, the ladle thou gavest me in kindness was destiny in turn. I am young and hale, and my pace quick. 'Tis only natural that I help here!'\nSo spoken, with more than half the ladle still filled, Saga took it into her steady hands, and turned and went for the mountain's shade.\n\n'Truly, what a fool.'\nA gust of wind blew by, cloud and ink scattering, the mountain path long and unending, and all trace of the old man had vanished.\n'Foolish and naive, but devout and sincere. She can go as she wishes.'",

          "description": "Tepid breaths caress her face, and a familiar view begins to come into focus. Returning to her senses, all that surrounds her is no different from how she recalls it. The burdenbeast carved of wood by her fellow disciple still leans against the old camphor tree, a little black tuskbeast pressed against it, polishing its tusks.\nThe rough, frayed strands of the bamboo hat's brim brush past her forehead, carrying the familiar smell of damp fiber. Saga is mentally startled, for the monk who paces before her is none other than her head priest. She hurriedly gathers her mind and corrects her posture, but her stiff back forbids her from standing up fully straight. When she first descended the mountain, the young Saga reached only to the head priest's shoulders in height, and now, she is stooped and decrepit by the weight of a hundred springs' rainshowers and a hundred autumns' falling leaves, and once again stands no taller than her head priest's shoulders.\n'Head priest, this humble servant of...'\nThe old head priest seems to pay no mind to what she was to say, and simply twists his head, signaling to her to move her legs, then unceremoniously thrusts out a mop. She can only drag her heavy legs, trembling shakily as she avoids it, while stammering in her perplexity. The mop's handle, Saga recognizes—it is the wooden pole with which the head priest fought her in the past. Only, for some unknown reason, it is now wrapped in cloth and given a new life cleaning floors.\n'This... This foolish disciple is ashamed, yet I still have doubts for which I must seek answers!\n'I travelled on the outside, and it has been a century at present, yet here and now, it seems to grow ever indistinct. When I first descended, I had thought clarity and sense to be given for all things, and indeed the realm abounded such that it eluded me, but in every place all still had answers to seek, and so in the scrolls of Master Dusk did I linger for ten turns of the year, and still felt naught but wonder.\n'Yet afterwards, that sense of which I believed in lost all sense. The more I saw, the more I felt that the people and the matters of the realm were all of the same single cloth. Our lives in the realm are no more than a mirror, perhaps reflecting oneself, or others, with color then drawn from every part that paints itself over the figure in the mirror, to mend, to make up, and no more. People paint that mirror full, so dense that no light passes, and believe they comprehend good and evil through, veracity from falsity. I sought knowledge and pursued learning for a century, and here in the end, I ask thee lookest within the bag of my travels, and see all I have obtained is dirtied mirrors. I do not understand. If the state of the realm is all but so, then where can Reason still be found?'\nOnly once Saga has finished speaking does the old head priest cease his handiwork and lift his head to answer: 'If you are a burdenbeast, then you can find it.' Thus he ends, and without waiting for further remark from her, he raises the mop, and strikes straight for her face.\n\nIt is afternoon when Saga awakes from her dream with a start. Screwing her eyes, she finds it was the burdenbeast she was travelling with, licking at her face with its rough tongue out of impatience.\n'Very well! Let us go!'",

Toddifons walked forward and looked at the bolthead buried in the bullseye, but failed to find any joy in her heart...\nThe entire testing field was a mess. Standard crossbow bolts were stuck in targets, two or three armor-piercing bolts were stuck in the wall, and several shattered targets bore the signs of explosives. The operator in charge of the field had never seen anything like this before and ran off to report up the chain, leaving Toddifons to tinker with the bolts out of spite. Before long, another bolt was firmly stuck in a target.\nWhen the testing field supervisor was dragged in by an operator, Toddifons was installing more lethal heads on the bolt, before turning to shoot her target full of holes.\nThe supervisor remained silent for a while, then, without looking back, pulled the operator along towards the workshop. Nobody knew what madness had gotten into Toddifons, but one thing was certain: if anyone dared to go in there, this crazy Vouivre would probably use them for target practice.\n...\nWhen Toddifons's supervising craftsman arrived at the testing field, the entire area looked like it had been carpet bombed, every target in sight has been thoroughly struck by Toddifons's siege crossbow. She was now sitting quietly next to the weapon, motionless as a volcano about to erupt.\nNobody had ever seen Toddifons like this before. No matter how the craftsman spoke to her, she remained unresponsive. So, after confirming that there were no bolts loaded into her crossbow, the craftsman asked the operator to come in and clean up, while continuing to try to communicate with Toddifons.\nIt's unclear how much time passed before she suddenly snapped out of it and asked her supervising craftsman about parts parameters and mechanical adjustments. The craftsman answered the questions one by one, and relieved a lot.\nIt seemed like the volcano wouldn't erupt today, he thought to himself. So he sat next to Toddifons, watching her adjust the siege crossbow and fire a new bolt that lodged itself dead center in the freshly-replaced bullseye. Just like before, Toddifons pulled out the bolt, looked at the target with disappointment on her face, and walked back to her weapon.\nThen, before the craftsman's eyes, she threw the bolt like a spear. It shattered the target and embedded itself in the wall of the testing field.\nAfter throwing it, Toddifons stared at her supervisor with her hands outstretched and an unusual look of helplessness in her eyes.\nIf left to her own devices, Toddifons might be stuck here until the end of time, but the craftsman had a better solution. He walked up to Toddifons and spoke softly:\n'We have an order to repair the defensive artillery in the city we're mooring in next week. If you have time, you can come and take a look.'",

The vast streets can be seen from the roof of this building, as well as the spotlights shone skyward from the gym several blocks out. Unlike Rim Billiton, there's no stench of slag on the evening breeze, nor the dust Rhodes Island so often faces in storms while sailing the wilds. It's clean, and strange for it.\nHer field mission concluded two hours ago. She made sure to put on her favorite band's bracelet as she set out from the Rhodes office. Had a whole disguise on and everything. Still got stopped outside the venue. 'Our tickets aren't for sale to the Infected. We need to ensure the safety of our other concertgoers,' the worker said, while taking a cautious step back. 'Sorry.'\n<i>Yeah, figures I'd get caught,</i> she ruefully thinks, stood below the looming white gymnasium walls. Infected have their own neighborhoods, their own perimeter walls, and their own checkpoints. Rhodes Island spent a week of classes teaching her that Oripathy wasn't something you could transmit just by brushing past someone else, but it's not like she can teach the whole city that.\nOh well. She's on the roof, right here, right now. She takes off her headphones.\nRhythmic cheers and shrieks pour out of the circular venue, indistinct by the time they reach her ears. They're a lot like the calls she used to hear from the mines. In this moment, they echo the beat of her heart. She reaches a hand out towards the spotlights in the sky, almost able to feel the air shaking. Even though that concert venue all bedazzled with lights feels as far away as the moon.\nIn that sea of noise, an extremely familiar intro faintly reaches her, every note mixed in with the city's clamor.\nShe needs to be careful. She can't get spotted. But she still waves her braceleted hand in time with the music, lightly singing as she does.\n<i>So lucky I got to apply for this field mission, seriously,</i> she thinks.",

Should've known Columbia was like this. Always has been.\nNo one who could've helped that kid. Went by the nickname 'Aciddrop.' Got into competitions. Glowed like the sun on the outer dunes back then. Now she caught Oripathy. Whereabouts... unknown. I wind this tape up, that marks one month she's been missing.\nStill remember how I taught her to use a crossbow. Spark in her eyes, same as my wife and kids. Touched your heart some more than a breeze in the woods, and my girl—girls—[CHUCKLE]—I thought to myself back then how I pretty much had two goddamn daughters. 'Aciddrop.' She was like part of our family. Like candy. Sometimes her father came, checked in on her. Gaulish man, built strong. Nothing but guilt and love in his eyes whenever he looked at his daughter. He and I drank. He said he didn't know how to be a good father. Could've said the same myself.\nUsed to figure with how our families knew each other, be one of the few fancy things in my old age, but that all changed. Overnight. Kid, uh... left two skateboards here with me. The ones I 'confiscated.' Dumped them in the junk room too. Rolled right under that army sword from Bolívar.\nI'm just an old guy. Saw these things happen before—never concerned me then. Wanted to do something... only today decided what. I know, look at me, death of a salesman. Best decision maker zero years running. Heh.\n[SILENCE]\nTaping two copies of this. Remember to send one to the kid if anyone finds her. I'll teach you how to fry onion rings for it. Secret's in the cheese.\n[SILENCE]\nThey've got the smarts to stick with their own. Not much chance I come out on top. Feel sorry for my girl. Her dad shouldn't be taking a risk like this. Makes me glad, though... I fessed up about all this and she was in tears. Gave me the go-ahead.\n[SILENCE]\nHey, kid. My daughter's all grown up now. How about you? Where you at?\nNo matter where you are, I bet you'll get along just fine.\nGangs. Hah. They gonna be scarier than the Steam Knights? Fire raining from the Witch King's spire?\n[SILENCE, POURING LIQUOR]\nRemember this, kid.\n'Cheers to freedom, cheers to onion rings, and cheers to me.'\n—Video cassette, previously held under strict safekeeping at a police station, sent to Rhodes Island after a case of station theft.

          "description": "She comes to in the corridor where she played as a child. She remembers; her father's working very late today. She's waiting in the corridor for him. The sunset clouds are chased in by autumn winds, and in this country town where no high-rise nor skyscraper stands, time's gifts are ever there to be seized at the first moments. Quietly, she pushes her father's door open and sees his stern expression—something has happened, her child's instincts say.\nShe comes to in the crook of her mother's arm. She remembers; she is nine now. She should be celebrating her birthday with her friends, sharing the cake. There should be candles aflame, yet the town burns. She sees her mother's face; in the instant she notices her daughter's gaze, the enmity and apprehension is hidden away behind the moon. The night is deep and dark, and her mother tells her it'll all be alright.\nShe comes to in a tent in the barrens. She remembers; this is their third month on the run. The incident in town seemed to serve as an excuse for all the other relatives to shun the mother and daughter. Her faith in and dependence on others left her in the sound of a single crash. She hasn't seen her father for so long now. She dearly wishes to cry and cry, and so she hugs her mother, but droplets hit the floor before she's even begun to weep.\nShe comes to beneath an unfamiliar carport. She remembers; her tenth birthday is very soon. Surrounding her are adults as frigid as ice, one by one forcing out a smile. She is a smart child, and knows these people mean well, but she's only a child all the same. The adults tell her that her mother is entrusting her to Rhodes Island. Her mother has left, like a cloud.\nShe comes to in brand-new bedding. She remembers; her arm is filled with bruising. She used a stolen sheet of sandpaper to rub at her once-smooth skin, hounding the flesh as though it'd atone. It hurts, and she dares not continue, but the moment she thinks of the black crystals, her throat is in the death grip of an all-choking emotion. She wants to vomit. She can't. She hasn't eaten in so very, very long.\nShe comes to the boom of floodwater. She remembers; Amiya and the Infected are still below. Those nameless heroes are resisting a mere Catastrophe. She lifts her head, and as the elements batter all, it suddenly strikes her that suffering is not a matter of great or small, and nor is hope. She throws herself down. Amiya must be alright, at the very least. She hears those behind her howling in fear. She hears them. Infected are drowning here, they say; when the flood recedes, will their water sources be polluted?\nShe comes to beneath a sunset as red as fire. She remembers; she saved a great many at Sugar City, a great many more than she could know. Her mother comes to mind. All at once, she feels sad, yet smiles. She understands her father, but still hasn't been able to find her mother. Can she find her? Will she ever? As the thought strikes her, she has a mild headache, but feels unusually unburdened.\nShe turns her head, and gives the great Feline as badly wounded as her a tremendous chewing-out. 'Blaze! Can't you wake me up any other way?!'",

The child began to think.\nHe would like to mend the castle, and continue his life from before.\nBut after the witch was gone, suppose the castle were to fall apart again; whatever would he do?\n\nHe thought and thought, until finally a perfect wish came to him:\n—I want to take the castle with me, away from the forest.\n\nHence, the child set upon the journey of his—\nAnd behind him was his tiny little castle, which seemed to look very much like him, and which forever protected him.\n\n—The Child's Castle, selected from The Jeffreys Collection of Fairytales New and Old",

          "description": "The Cautus boy has never met his parents. He has only ever seen their faces on a couple of group photos.\nWhile apparently this is not at all uncommon for children born on board Rim Billiton's mining ships, it isn't something one would consider normal, either.\n\nLike many other Cautus children, the boy is very active and tends to get into trouble every now and then.\nIt might therefore be hard for those who rarely visit the library to imagine him pouring through the books on technology his father left behind.\nThe most likely source of this habit is an erudite old man with whom he is not related, who has always kept him company and reprimanded him since he was a child.\n\nWith such an unusual guardian, the boy had some perfectly natural questions for someone in his position.\nWho were his parents? How did they die?\nThe boy does actually have a vague idea. He long ago learned from the books what the equipment and instruments his father was standing next to in the photo meant.\nThe boy is much more delicate than he appears. He is worried that perhaps the reason that no one ever mentioned his father until he broached the subject is because his father had put everyone in danger with a work accident. That they avoided the subject so he wouldn't feel guilty.\n\nThe erudite old man can see that the boy has his misgivings. However, he had promised Alisha that he'd take care of her child, that he'd never let him choose the arduous path that his father once walked. That he'd never tell her child that his father spent his last moments selflessly entering collapsed caves to rescue strangers that didn't believe him, under the guise of conducting a post-Catastrophe inspection, and that he'd keep him from thinking that his father was to blame for his mother's final days in depression.\nHowever, there was one lie that the old man cannot bring himself to tell the child. He doesn't have what it takes to tell the child that his father wasn't a hero. As the ship's former Catastrophe Messenger, the old man cannot help but take pride in the young man who found himself here after being framed in Victoria, but nevertheless dedicated himself to fighting Catastrophes.\n\n'But, Alisha... Didn't you name your child Leonhardt because you were hoping he could be like his father...?'\n\nPerhaps it is the fate of his bloodline at work, but the boy could not be dissuaded from studying to become a Catastrophe Messenger. He met friends with whom he could trust his life, and he quickly earned the recognition of many of those around him.\nThat came much later, though.",

          "description": "It's late at night, and Susie's still flipping through her textbook. She has Originium Arts Theory tomorrow, and this is her final chance to review. Her workbook lays open to the side, strewn with soundly proofed notes of all the bits she had no idea of (or the wrong idea).\n<i>It's time you slept...</i> Her falling eyelids give her a nudge.\nAnd so, just before going to bed, she stuffs everything she needs for the exam tomorrow in her bag, peeks over her shoulder, and flips her daily scheduler open. What she'll be up to each day, sorted neat and tidily in here—a habit she picked up from working at Quercus's. Procurement, punctual opening and closing, running inventory, cleaning the shop... With so much to do—none of it trivial—on top of frequent and ever-urgent surprises, having everything she needed written out gave her no small relief.\nHer schedule for tomorrow runs as follows:\nMorning\n(7:30-9:30) Exam time!\n(9:30-10:30) TA for Intro to Originium Arts Theory\nNoon\n(12:00-13:00) Help out at hairdressers\nAfternoon\n(14:00-16:00) Practice a bit at training grounds/tidy up plant nursery for Lena (ask first, might not be today)\n(17:00-18:00) Help out at hairdressers\n(18:00-21:00) Help out at bar\n(21:00-22:00) Reading break\nSusie stares and thinks. After a moment, she shortens her shift at the bar and adds a new item below it:\n(20:00-?) Have a talk with Theory tutor about future\nWith how responsible Rhodes Island's tutors and operators all are, she's not one bit worried she'll fail the exam. But as for what's in store for her from now on? That's definitely a conversation her tutor can help with.\nThese days, she's gotten the static that once exploded out of her a little under control, and—though hardly anyone notices—she's already started using little tricks from her casting course in her hairdressing. A tactical dab of electrical charge here and there for even swifter, cleaner haircuts.\nAnd all, so that one day—\nSusie leafs forward through the scheduler a little, and stops. Out in the midst of all these untouched pages, there's one event, a single note that's been written long, long in advance:\nSend money to Mum\nMum keeps telling her she doesn't need to do anything of the sort, but she can't help wanting to send something back home. And this is about when Mum'd always send her money too—somehow, it's become their unofficial way of letting each other know they're still well.\nSusie flips the scheduler back to tomorrow, and gives the freshly filled-in cells a few strokes of her fingers.\nShe's a grounded person. She knows that whatever far-flung future she's imagining, it's not her life in the here and now. She likes to give each book a proper read, do each job well, catch each opportunity when it comes. Imagination's a volatile thing, after all... Still, her current everyday, her life aboard Rhodes Island, is one that so clearly rewards her for her efforts, and isn't that precisely what she's wanted all along?\nSo she corrects that item a little:\n(20:00-?) Have a talk with Theory tutor about upcoming course\n<i>That's</i> what she should be asking.\nTime to turn in now... Her heavy eyes tug at her lids, desperate to pull down the shutters.\nSo she heeds, puts away the scheduler, turns off the lights, and tries to calm her nervously fluttering heart. She'll get good marks tomorrow. It's in her power.\nTomorrow's still a busy day, and tomorrow will reward her for it.\n......\nSusie falls into deep, warm, contented slumber.",

Where am I gonna get Blacksteel from? We lost a guy just trying to get this stuff.'\n'I need guns I can use! This shit is as good to me as a hammer!' The Vouivre bossman gets angrier, and an assortment of Vouivran musclemen line up behind him.\n'How are you going to use a gun if you can't do Originium Arts? Take it or leave it, I don't refund deposits.' The Sarkaz merchant waves his hand, and one after another, his partners draw their blades behind him.\n'I can fix this.'\nAs the hostility boils over, a young Vouivran man comes out from the corner. His face is stony, his build frail enough to not even seem Vouivre, and his head of red hair majorly garish.\n'I can make those guns usable, and it'd only cost you this much.'\nBoth sides seem convinced by this conservative bid, and make way for him to approach. They watch as the youngster comes up, cracks open the toolkit he keeps on him, and picks up one of the guns. The complete firearm is reduced to parts in his hands, before becoming whole again. His movements aren't fast by any measure, but nobody can tell what happened.\nThe youngster hands the bossman the assembled gun, who doubtfully accepts it. After cautiously fumbling with it, he points the muzzle at the air and pulls the trigger. A clear gunshot resounds through the whole black market.\n'It can only fire one shot. If you want it completely functional, I'll have to take it back to my workshop.'\nEveryone present was ready to slit throats a moment ago, but now all are in unanimous accord. A dozen pairs of eyes focus on the youngster, as if they've found something worth far more than the goods.\n'Boy, what did you do just now?'\n'Don't be twitchy, just hand it over and nothing bad will happen.'\nAs everyone closes in step by step, he suddenly grins and laughs:\n'You foolish philistines! Trying to get a peek of true power with your petite experience? Let me tell you, weapons have souls! Only the truly wise, the truly noble can resonate with them!'\nFor a moment, the chaotic scene once again falls quiet as can be.\n'Lunatic,' the Sarkaz spits.\nThe bossman pulls a whole pile of cash from his briefcase and hands it to the youngster, while the Sarkaz merchant takes the rest and leaves, not bothering with a single glance back.\n'Boy, you can keep your secrets if you want. I'll give you money and a workspace, and you work for me. How does that sound?' He offers an invitation to the bizarre youth.\n'Deal.'\nThe youngster takes up residence in the workroom the bossman gives him. Late at night, he carefully fills a notepad with the quantity and models of the guns from earlier that day, annotated with 'Columbian make, smuggled into Sargon by Sarkaz merchant, circumstances unclear.'\n'Good. We start from here.'",

Each of the heroes, seemingly just as young as them, had a shiny and glowy Originium blade and could use super-awesome techniques that made the whole screen flicker and shine like crazy, and it got everyone watching all pumped up. But then Shamare, who's always so cold, was there all alone like 'that sword's obviously just a toy' like she didn't get the mood at all.\nBubble wasn't one to say much about weapons, really. Swords were all light and fragile, and they'd never beat the cool stuff like giant axes and hammers.\nBut when she saw the friends she'd watched the film with get together one day and bring swords out, that really drove her nuts.\nThey were just like the ones in the movie! The shininess, the little button, and the dashing-ness that exuded from her friends when they lifted their swords to the air and yelled out the super-awesome move name.\nAnd like that, a need to HAVE overtook Bubble's heart.\nShe couldn't steal anyone's—she'd been scolded enough times already for that—but she had no idea how she'd get one like that for herself.\nBy buying it? How? From who? With what? She didn't even know how many rooms were inside this metal plate box, not to mention her friends were telling her they got shipped in from Kazimierz and she can't buy one now.\nWhy can't Bubble get the thing she wants?! It was all her mind could dwell on, but here she is now, and she doesn't know anything, except that aside from stealing someone else's she's got no way of getting the toy. But the lessons she's been having lately, and the sense of morals educated into her, stifle her urge to snatch one.\nSo now Bubble can only storm around in a huff, carelessly knocking into things and yelling loudly to vent her discontent. On occasion, when she tuckers herself out, she hides away in her dorm, crying as she hugs her tribe's totem.\nThis helplessness weighs down on Bubble very, very hard.\nMorte tastes this morsel and shares it with Shamare. After getting the rough gist of things, Shamare seeks out a psychological consultant operator at Medical, and very soon thereafter, a message is sent from HR out to Sargon...\nToday is Bubble's annual 'See Papa Day,' in which her father has agreed to come visit her once a year. It's the most important day of the year to her (aside from her birthday), and Bubble forces herself to shape up and look strong, to meet Papa with a smile. Even still, once she sees him, the gloom in her heart all spills out as tears, and she can't even put her words together properly, only lie in her Papa's arms and cry away.\nAfter the tears are done, she jumps out of her Papa's embrace, and sits silently on the couch again. And surprise! From his rucksack, her father pulls out a toy sword.\nIt's in this instant that Bubble's eyes shine like stars.",

Upon going to confront him the next day, Snowsant found he had already been arrested by the L.G.D., and his stall had been shut down.\n- Two coins from Higashi, given by Saga for mending her mokugyo. Should be exchangeable for a more widely adopted currency if she saves up enough and ever gets the chance to visit Higashi, so she's holding onto them for now!\n- Three Kazimierzian copper hellers, gifted by Blemishine. Kazimierz has long ceased circulation of these old hellers; Blemishine happened to find them sandwiched in her armor while repairing it and gave them to Snowsant as souvenirs. Will they ever be of use? Unsure.\n- One Gaulish copper livre, corroded, from an investigation mission on a formerly-Gaulish site. While Gaul was still around, it was about 10 livres to 1 LMD. (Not that anybody would do business in denominations that small.) As for nowadays, maybe some collectors would be interested?\n- A few Columbian gold certificates, each with a face value of three dollars. According to Jessica, Columbia never issued money of this value, but that doesn't mean it's fake! Maybe Jessica just didn't know about it.\n- A crude copper coin engraved with Gavial's portrait, handed out by Tomimi. She said it was a precious coin once cast by the 'Gavial's Will' tribe, but Gavial herself refuses to admit this. Tomimi guarantees there are people out there who still acknowledge its worth.\n- An expired Rhodes Island Cafeteria dessert voucher. Snowsant uses it to remind herself—never ever forget to double check when a voucher is valid for!",

It was only a little thing I bought while carrying out a mission in Yan, but the local said it'd been blessed at the temple. Someone tells me I can go and ask Purestream. Purestream... I'm not too familiar with the name. Maybe it's a new operator handling lost and found at Logistics?\nIt's not in my dorm...\nOr the meeting room...\nI find her at the baths. She's just finished repair work, and now she's—well, bathing. I can even hear her singing from outside the door. It's loud, clear and perfect... but don't you feel icky bathing for that long?\n'Sorry, sorry, I know I kept you waiting.'\n'Rhodes Island's sewage work is up to the task, but they've really been overlooking cleaning the filtration system itself. The vast majority of areas have blockages. You need to get into them frequently! All I can do is hang on until the whole cleaning job's done before I... heheh.'\n'Is this your charm? Come and take a look.'\nThe girl absentmindedly talks as she opens a bag. Aside from my talisman, I can see marbles, hair clips, test tubes, and even an ammo magazine...\n'Did you... find all of these in the sewage filtration system?'\n'Yup. It was covered in mud when I found it, absolutely filthy, but I've already thoroughly cleaned it.'\nI'm about to ask 'how could it have gotten there,' but I hold it back. I should be asking myself that...\nLater, I'm chatting with a friend in Engineering about the landship breaking down and getting repaired. Nobody would've called the problem being the sewage systems. Operator Purestream took on the cleanup task all alone after only a day of her job, and she'd spent two whole days inside the filthy inner filtration system... blockages in a few specific areas were the 'main culprits,' all the 'treasures' we'd accidentally lost and couldn't find. I remember Purestream sort of shyly smiled when I told her thanks, and she just urged me to 'take care from now on,' giving me a precautions while she was at it. Water could flush everything away, so we'd gotten used to just twisting taps and pushing on valves, simple as that. It was precisely because water could flush everything that we never knew how dirty it'd gotten, somewhere out of our sights.\nI hear Purestream's in charge of Rhodes Island landship sewage work now. I didn't know what she liked, so all I could figure was to buy some scented soap and send it to her. I only found out later she'd gotten piles of it by that point.

The shop says Leithanians use this little tool when beginning to learn music, in order to help them grasp tempo. But conversely, '100 Ways to Up Your Concentration' says having a regular sound playing helps focus your attention, as people will map out the thoughts in their head to the rhythm, thus untangling their logic. 'Tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, tock, pebbles, twigs, outside, everywhere, pretty, favorite, I want to look, I'll look right now...'\n-SOUND BATH. 'Bathed in pure, long, and gentle tones, you will come to find serenity, and concentrate upon the self.' '*ding*—' It... sounds like Pramanix's bell, it's so reassuring... I wonder if this was from Kjerag too? I remember there was a holy mountain there, since Cliffheart's told me heaps about the place. I'd like to visit too one day, sooner or later—I'm sure there'd be so much geological knowledge to pick up on! The Black Flow's on the bucket list too. Maybe I should consult Asbestos about it beforehand? That door she has looks so hefty...\n-ATTENTION SPAN TRAINING CARDS. This one's a present from Skyfire after she heard I was starting attention training. 'Suitable for children ages 3-5. WARNING: CHOKING HAZARD.' Why did she buy me this?\n-BANDAGES FOR WHEN A BOOK BITES. These aren't to do with attention training, I simply saw them on the table just now and put them in here with everything else, hehe.\n-PEBBLE. Saga told me that to concentrate on but one thing before thee, one item, be it even the most mundane and unremarkable stone, would settle thee down, and see that thou wouldst ponder the primitive and true. She led me through some meditation, to focus my attention, but eventually... the natto gohan was just too tasty to resist.\nThen comes the forty-third time she's wandered off. Her attention training is declared a failure, and consequently her journaling ends there. The final item noted is a fire extinguisher.\n-FIRE EXTINGUISHER. I put out the flames that started from Skyfire flaring up. I think... I think it's better than any other tool at addressing the most frightening consequences of being unfocused...\nOhh... but still, I have to make a proper apology...",

The human traffickers in Minos are indeed despicable, but they fall under Minoan jurisdiction. The original plan only called for us to rescue the Infected children, not eliminate the suspects.'\n'Isn't it normal to adjust mission objectives in our line of work? Pith, you oughta trust Rosmontis's judgment.'\n'Have you heard? Surviving witnesses refer to her as the 'Scourge of Minos.' Fortunately, the girl herself doesn't remember any of it. Touch says she had forgotten all details of the mission by the time she returned to the ship. I'm not sure her brain will manage to derive any worthwhile experience from the whole thing.'\n'Memories aren't always useful experiences, sometimes they can be heavy burdens. Since her opinions aren't colored by her own prejudices, and she isn't hemmed in by community consensus, Rosmontis might be even more impartial than we are. She's like a mirror that can't be stained, reflecting the morality of the situations around her.'\n'That's why Kal'tsit wants us to guide her together. Even if her actions reflect our values, Rhodes Island won't be with her her whole life. Once we're gone, who can judge the mirror itself, whether she's good or evil?'\n'She's awake now, Pith. We can ask her ourselves.'\nHello, Outcast.\n'Hello, Rosmontis.'\nAre you leaving, Outcast?\n'Yes, I'm off to Victoria for a little something. But Pith is right, I'll be gone, Kal'tsit will be gone, and someday, we'll all be gone.'\n'Will Amiya be gone too?'\n'Could be. Nobody knows the future. Judge Rosmontis, Your Little Honor, can you look after yourself for us?'\nYes, I promise. I promise everyone that I'll write everything down. I remember the stories you and Pith told me. I won't forget.\nI can do it, you and Pith don't need to worry.\nIf I ever turn bad... no, no matter what I become in the future.\nI'll document it all, I'll look over it carefully.\nThe last one I will judge will be me, myself.",

In the meantime, I'm attempting to remodel the Bionic Seadragon—strengthen connectivity between the internal conductor unit and water cannon lock-on system. In future battles, with support from Leaf and his friends, the water cannon's going to be much more accurate.\n\nBionic Seadragon Development Log 04\nBeen asked by an operator about the names again. It really is just for differentiating. Fundamentally, using '-1' or '-X' or '-β' on their serials would be fine, but using names like Leaf makes things a little more convenient... I don't really get what everyone's so curious about.\n\nBionic Seadragon Development Log 06\nTwo Bionic Seadragon core components damaged, can't be reused. Seems I'll have to iterate on their entirety. Closure wants to take the opportunity to customize them, and I refused. Lancet-2 and Castle-3 are very cute, and Operator Mayer's Meeboos have very fun interaction patterns, but I can't picture Leaf and his friends fitted with voice modules. They're doing fine as is.\n\nBionic Seadragon Development Log 09\nI've had contact with new onboards Operator Irene and Operator Lumen, so roughly got the picture of what's happened and what's happening in Iberia. The locked drawers are opened wide. As the forbidden zones start to expand, any 'secrets' will automatically reveal themselves to the people, and cause either a crisis that'll take everyone's collective effort to deal with, or a nightmare no one could escape... Sealing it away is meaningless now. No one can stand forever on the shore.\nOperator Irene took note of Leaf—not for her functionality, obviously. She's sharp for a young Inquisitor. The Bionic Seadragon was indeed created referencing designs handed down within my family. I've conjectured how those designs were formed, what they represent, what special meaning they hold, what information they hide. Perhaps I should say, what they were modeling... Of course, since leaving Iberia, they haven't been very meaningful conjectures, or very concrete. What if they do have something to do with my family, and Iberia, and the ocean's past? More importantly, with the tide surging onto the land, is there any possibility it could concern the future?\n......\nMaybe I should go have another talk with Irene. Maybe I should add a few new items to the Bionic Seadragon research project.",

          "description": "'From a scientific perspective, this great land we presently inhabit is abundant with mediums of complex composition. Here on Terra, the medium is commonly known as air, and it isn't substantially different from the liquid medium filling the ocean. Ægir living in inland Iberia often make use of their analogous knowledge of the sea to produce toys like this, that drift unimpeded through the air.'\nSuch was the answer Weedy gave, when the operators of Rhodes discovered the N.B.P. floating about in a cabin, to explain the origins of the seemingly unattested equipment.\n'Is it some kind of common sea custom?'\nWeedy silently watches the prototype lilt back down to the ground. The urge hit her out of nowhere to tell them that Iberia wasn't nearly the seaside place most thought of it as, but had vast and arid lands to its name as well. Still, even at Rhodes Island, some were still caught up in the impression of stiffness that the tense, fiercely isolationist nation tended to leave.\nShe folded up the N.B.P.'s soft wings and stowed it back in its box. 'To clarify, I've never been back to the sea before, and don't know much about the Ægir. Like you, I've never been to Ægir itself either. I may have been born an Ægir, but what I know is sandstorms, misty dawns and thick jungles, the dry inland—less so the coral on the coast. When I was still young, I went out into our desertified lands with my mother, using bioengineering to treat it with technology. When we had downtime from our field work, she'd fly toys like these for us to run after. There wasn't any kind of special significance to it—it was just a pastime.'\nShe thought back to her home soil of Iberia. The Profound Silence was merciless in revising their place in the country, especially after the Inquisition 'visited' their doorstep to forbid the family from 'spreading dangerous Ægir technology.' As far as most Ægir living in Iberia were now concerned, 'Ægir' was no more than the name that branded them, and ever more vaguely at that.\n'You already had bionic technology this developed back then?'\n'What you see here is actually a successor model I made recently. It now has the propulsion capacity to 'float' in quicksand, and... also some flaws.' With that, Weedy picked up the box and left the cabin.\nOnly she knew that this improved model, the spitting image of an aquatic creature, had lost all ability to enter the water.",

          "description": "To Pudding, nothing beats the time spent kicking back and relaxing in a Sami cabin. \nOn Sami's south border, Columbians have obtained land and resources from the Sami through trade, nomadic cities following caravans and mining ships crossing age-old tundra. The founding of trade enclaves represents the first time in a century the Sami have opened borders, Columbian caravans and corporate engineer teams becoming frequent guests at Sami's frontier. Ever since she was young, Pudding's frequently gone with her parents to Sami, headed for that ancient land. \nIce and snow blanket the earth wide, sunshine spilling over and refracting, as if a realm paved full with gems. But this is only one corner of Sami. \n'On the tundras of Sami far from civilization, in the forever hibernal Fjal Vetrtonn, most Sami by far still carry on their millennium-old ancient way of life. They're far removed from the Columbian enclave, indifferently surveying all from the Fjal Vetrtonn and bone-chilling winds. Time freezes upon their skin,' says the Sarkaz owner of the coffee shop. 'Don't you want to go deeper and see? See the sights of those tundras and mountains, how the Sami get along with nature in the wilderness.' \n'Am I allowed to?' Pudding hesitantly asks. 'I'm not sure if they'd welcome a city person like me...' \n'Sami does not defy its own fate. We know what it faces, and know how it will respond.' \nAnd so Pudding signs up to join a local supporting construction project, departing early morning one day, going with the team of Columbian engineers into the Myrkwood that she once only gazed at from afar. \nIn the primordial woods, the Sami steadfastly distance from modern technology. Only one subset, a wetland settlement near to the autonomous region, is willing to receive the Columbian engineers' help. \nConstructing a base station, connecting cables, turning on the village's first bulbs... Pudding stares at the faint lights, and the grin of satisfied wonderment on some Sami faces, and it suddenly hits her just what technology means to these people. \nBut it's only in places more remote still, where the true secrets of the Sami lie, a land the Columbians cannot pry into. \nPudding's vacation will be over very soon. She writes up her experiences in the village into a report, and puts it inside her suitcase, ready to take it back to Columbia. \nI'll come back again very soon, she thinks happily. \nYet because of one accident, this hope, ordinary by all rights, spends a long, long time delayed, before she can make good on it.",

          "description": "When she had to face a Sarkaz who stood two heads taller than her, wielding a supposedly state-of-the-art 'particle vibration cutting blade,' she removed a bottle-shaped earring from her ear. Inside it was her carefully blended green-orange blossom scent. It was thanks to this aroma that she didn't get motion sickness on her way here.\nThis time, she and her coworker were dealing with a gang of fugitives, and the man before her was the leader of the entire group. She wasn't skilled in close combat, but the job was urgent, and the commission generous. They had forced this weapon into her hands, expecting her to report various performance and parameter details after the operation, as if it were only natural for her to use this weapon to kill the Sarkaz before her.\nHe hung a stolen knife from his waist and disdainfully displayed the winding scars on his forearm. She did everything she could to appear unmoved, but her heartbeat quickened.\nShe saw him draw the knife and adopt an aggressive stance, but she suspected it could be a feint. Then, he swung the blade. She made the correct judgment at the last moment, assuming a stance, but she was still too slow. Her weapon had already been cleaved in half.\nBefore the next strike came, she proactively threw herself to the ground, crushing the earring in her hand.\nShe caught a strong whiff of the orange blossom scent and was certain that the Sarkaz smelled the same fragrance. So she looked up to see his expression change from ferocity to confusion, and finally, there was even a touch of softness that contrasted with his face. His lips marred by scarring twitched, hesitating. If there had been enough time, who knew what words they might have uttered.\nYet before they could, she leaped up, driving the half-blade into the Sarkaz's chest. His eyes widened and he fell backwards onto the ground.\nShe pulled the half-blade out of his chest, warm blood splattering her hand.\nSuddenly, she felt like crying, as if she had just killed a close friend she had spent years with. But that wasn't true. She only smelled a fragrance.\nShe had already determined its effects upon concocting it: low concentration for alleviating motion sickness, high concentration to induce a false sense of relaxation and intimacy, a means to save herself in critical moments. The Sarkaz didn't know any of this; he believed there was some forgotten history between them, which is why he died by her blade. However, she knew it was just hormonal fluctuations induced by the drugs that got him killed. Not only did she know this, she also knew that in another five seconds, after the scent of orange blossoms had completely dissipated, the false emotions would vanish.\nFive seconds passed quickly.\nAs expected, she was no longer sad; she just started to detest herself.\nBecause she remembered that the earrings were a gift she had given herself on the day she joined. Back then, she really just wanted a pair of aromatherapeutic earrings to relieve her motion sickness.",

They did not save you alone.\nAs if she had heard her Maestro pass judgment on her, she let out a great breath, and for the first time conceded her loss.\n\n'High Inquisitor Dario's darling disciple'—as many people came to speak of her later on.\nIf the proper verdict is not written in the Scriptures, then it must come from her Maestro's mouth.\nShe was so firm of faith, yet could never pass evaluation.\nUntil one time, she involuntarily blurted out a judicial opinion contrary to her Maestro.\nHer Maestro repealed her verdict, but gave her a nod to see.\n\n'Inquisitor Irene'—so she frequently proclaimed herself, from the day she was formally appointed by the Inquisition.\nHer Maestro spoke that she had to make her own judgments.\nShe turned through the past archives again and again, sped to scenes of greatest danger one after another, and within a few brief years, she had resolved close to a hundred cases.\nEach time she reported her verdicts to her Maestro, he would refuse to comment.\nUntil they bade farewell on the shore of Gran Faro, and she confronted the ocean alone and the menace it delivered.\nThe Scriptures, the Maestro, and the Self.\nAll wills merged as one in the face of true danger, becoming the fire that blazes forth from her handcannon.\n\n'Irene, Inquisition Messenger of Iberia.'\nSo the dainty Liberi introduced herself aboard Rhodes Island.\nShe still proudly lifts her head. The look in her eyes is more resolute than it ever was before, undying as the reefs of Iberia's coastline that will never see themselves drowned again.",

          "description": "The youth wraps the untied bindings once more.\nThey were bound into thick layers, concealing the heavy sword—though it could hardly be called concealed, given its size, and its outline was clearly visible even completely covered. Its crossguard was wider than most people's arms, and its blade longer than most people were tall. The sealed sword showed nary a hint of edge, and while it was unable to kill in this state, the sight of it was enough to send a shiver down anyone's spine—perhaps this was its purpose, perhaps the youth who carried the blade did not wish to take anyone's life. He simply wished to have a sword, for merely having a sword was itself a message to his opponents. That a bloody death was at hand, that all that it would take was to remove some flimsy bindings—so do not remove those bindings.\nThis really was what the youth thought. He deliberately wrapped his sword in bindings, hid its edge, concealed it, placed it where no one could see it. The blade required patience. Patience could avoid wearing it down, patience could avoid bloody carnage. Yet even if you remain patient for years, even if you placed it where no one could see it, it would still show its one true use at a glance. And so the youth treated the sword this way, just as the youth treated himself.\nHe said 'I am the sword, I am its cutting edge, but I must be hidden away and concealed.' He used to carry himself as such, taking his anger, his torments, his suffering, his joy, his excitement, his inspiration, and burying them within the thick layers of bindings, body and soul both stretched taut.\nBut now, it seems like everything has changed.\nEnemies appear from all directions—though it could hardly be called appearing, for the youth had already imagined them deep in the dense forests of Einwald, below the rainclouds of Sturmland, within the great lakes and rivers of Wasserland, entrenched atop the mud and stones of Erdenherre, their silhouettes doing their dealings amongst the spires, darting between the palaces, the academies, and the mansions. So these were hardly a surprise to him, but he simply did not expect today's situation. When a time comes where push truly comes to shove, might he find that he can no longer see their faces clearly, or know where they were? The enemy is not yet at hand, yet he knows that they are everywhere. He had clearly bound the wrapping in thick layers, yet why did he feel so exposed these days? He had anticipated, prepared for this day. Had known it would come. Fremont had already warned him earlier: this is a battle you chose yourself.\nIt is a battle I chose myself, the youth thought, his sword sealed anew.",

And wind came forth in great gusts, and rolled over Her shoulders and Her back, and through the interstices of Her fingers, howling as it did. To the people of Kjerag, this wind would be felt a colder one.\nThen wind's howls turned to chaos, its tight shrieks ushered to fray by words of somnolence, as a song rent and shattered over a million risings and settings of the sun and flew about Her forever. So the chatter grew and grew in the air, till it reached out with a black thorn. And a black raindrop hung upon the thorn's tip, and it seemed that it would fall to the land, and fall betwixt the mountains and the trees, and see that the mountains and the trees would become of its likeness. It was cacophony, and it was infinitely hostile, and it heeded no disobedience. This was Danger.\nSo She thought to stir, yet She found it now took considerable energy, which it had not done before.\nThereupon She forged into the snow of a million suns, and She sought as if seeking the tail of a threadmade cloth, and about Her finger wound a tail of this thread. And so the air changed in its flow, and the snow flew to the air by Her will, and thus was woven a curtain of it. And She put this curtain to the black rain, and drove it from the land at Her feet, in the manner She had done countless times before.\n'Kjarr? Kjarr?'\nThrough the curtain of wind and snow, a soft calling breaks, and reaches her ears again. Kjarr snaps out of her brief daze, half-woven cloth nestled in her lap. She finds her needle still in one hand, yet the tail of her thread fallen from the other, back into the pile.\n'I'm sorry, Saintess, I believe my mind wandered.'\nThis is her third day learning weaving from the Saintess. The chamber of the Vine-Bear Court they're in is hung with tapestries woven by Enya's own hand. For Enya, pursuing textiles is just another part of her spiritual devotions.\n'Oh... I see. Perhaps I'm teaching a little too fast for you?'\nSat face to face with Kjarr, there is absolutely no blame in Enya's words, her face almost twisted with humble apology. She holds her own needle and wound thread, with a cloth much like Kjarr's draped over the crook of her arm, but hers is far more complete, it seems, far more beautiful.\n'I wouldn't say that. Certainly easier to follow than your recitations of the scriptures.'\nHearing that, Enya smiles as she reaches into the wool pile, picks out the loose tail, and hands it back to Kjarr.\n'And yet I hardly leave you so lost in thought when I recite.'\nKjarr takes the tail, the warmth of Enya's intent lingering at her fingertips. She'll be finishing this cloth.\n'It strikes me, Saintess, that your stitch, and Her stitch of the blizzard, might in some ways be not so different.'\nAnd the blizzard whips up outside the window, almost hard enough to stir the tapestries inside.\nTo her, there returns a close and longed-for feeling.",

Lunacub has her own dormitory (even if she's not often indoors), and camping on the deck violates Rhodes Island safety and firefighting regulations, but still she assiduously avoids patrols, setting up her tent on the deck again and again, always somewhere where she can get a clear view of the sky.\nThe tent was built by Lunacub herself, although 'built' might not be the best word: it moreso resembles fabric pieced together into one, then propped up as best she can so the wasteland gales don't blow it down so easily. What's noteworthy is where the fabric originates—\nFollowing Lunacub's eleventh time this quarter attempting to sneak into the warehouse and tripping the security system, Rhodes Island HR had a thorough conversation with her, and found in her possession several unregistered Rhodes Island uniforms (parts of which were shorn off and sewn into her tent). Lunacub's manners were impeccable during the conversation, expressing that she was 'just passing by,' and that 'on the outside, you can take stuff if nobody's watching it.' HR rectified the lapse in Lunacub's understanding, reiterated Rhodes Island discipline, as well as inquired as to where certain other parts of the tent fabric had come from.\n'The grey cloth? I found it in the forest. It was hanging on a tree. I pulled it down.'\n'This one's really warm, so it's really useful when it snows. I found it too, buried in a hole. Agnese told me about it.'\n'This one's amazing, it stops water! Someone gave it to me. I know what that look is—really, he did! I gave him directions, and he said it was payment!'\n'No, this isn't... um, these clothes are okay because they went through proceedings? You said something about application proceedings—how do you do that?'\n'This pelt is my friend's. I miss her a lot.'\nLunacub declined HR's proposal to provide her with a standard-issue Rhodes Island tent.",

          "description": "There's a strange noise to her six. Lemuen pivots and points, gun aimed at the source.\nIt's a drone. The instant she sees the 'precision instruments' mounted on it, Lemuen surmises its owner. The drone buzzes and hangs in the airflow.\n'What's the joke this time?' she says, her sigh tinted with frustration. Eyeing the lens of the drone, Lemuen puts her gun down.\n'You didn't come for me today. That's my win.\n'It looks like after ninety-nine days, you've hit your limit, Lemuen.' There's a hint of playfulness in the voice carried by the drone.\n'Time's a limited resource. I don't have enough to keep wasting on keeping a problem girl entertained.\n'Anyway, is this little cutie attending class for you again today, Lia?' Lemuen continues to head for the school building. Having the drone she calls the 'little cutie' tag along behind her is something she's all but used to by now.\nThrough the drone's video cam, Serpilia surveys the pink-tinged, long-haired Sankta. Once the headmaster and teaching faculty had given up on urging her to attend classes, this pink-haired Sankta was left to tackle the dumb matter of 'telling Serpilia to come to class' all alone.\nIt's, well, how to put it? Real amusing. Worth watching closely.\nStaring at the transmitted image with all the patience in the land, Serpilia is an observer to the pink-hair's every move, to how she'll try and find Serpilia today, or maybe the little 'gift' Serpilia's prepared for her.\nShe loses herself for just an instant when a 'thump' comes through, and she realizes the pink-hair's wrecked another of her drones.\n'That drone just now was a holographic image. This one's the real 'cutie,' isn't it? You can't waste good technology like this.\n'Enough hiding. If you want to observe me, there's no better way than standing in front of me and taking a good long look. Very, very, carefully.'\n'Auuugh, guess that wouldn't fool you after all...' Serpilia hops down from the roof, totally deflated, and flops over on a bench near Lemuen.\n'Still, it's my win.\n'And you doubled your loss. Once for giving up on making me come to class, and again for using your gun to shoot down the little gift I gave you.'\n'Oh?\n'Well, why not take another look around you?' Right on cue, there's a shrill whistle, then an orderly formation of students, each head topped with seven or eight scoops of ice cream, comes rushing past. Serpilia's face is the picture of bewilderment.\n'It's time for class, Lia. Today's Social Activities will be about escorting desserts outdoors.' The pink-haired Sankta props herself up on the bench. Serpilia turns her head away, wanting to avoid Lemuen's line of sight, but is blinded by the fierce sunlight.\nIn all the commotion of the street, all Serpilia can catch is Lemuen's murmur.\n'Send me your 'little cutie' once you fix her up, and don't forget to spray it a color I like.'",

Family, loyalty, freedom, future, she has no clear awareness of any of it at that age. She just grits her teeth and endures training too ruthless in some measures for a child, and in her wide eyes gleams light—she wants to be what her strongest senpais are, reach the top, offer her loyalty to the lord.\nBut she doesn't know what 'offer her loyalty' means. She just knows it's an honor, it's what her parents and herself want to do, so she has to do it.\n\nA Kazemaru no longer cleaning the mud from her head again seeks out the young lord.\nShe has become the lord's shinobi. Her hair is bound beneath her hat, her nails orderly trimmed, and missions arrive secretly one after another from the bamboo tubes into her hands. Kazemaru pulls out the scroll inside, and silently looks over. The name she has no recognition of written at the top of that scroll is about to silently lose everything he originally possessed, all before a single fowl is startled.\n'Well done.'\nSo the lord often commends her, but while in hiding, she hears a mother in another courtyard scolding her crying child: 'Keep crying, and the people in black will take you away!'\n\nThe young lord looks at his employee whose head is covered in mud.\nShe changes out of the black bodysuit, and will no longer receives scrolls in bamboo tubes. The old lord has passed, and Kazemaru has a new outfit.\nThe meeting room isn't secret, but it's cramped and inaccessible; contracts fly back and forth in the open, but it's all too smooth and steady. As the days wear on, Kazemaru flexes her stiffened spine at her office desk, joints chafing with a 'krrk,' and the last time she heard that noise, it was like a hidden weapon scraped at her bones.\nShe doesn't like sitting, nor becoming one of the 'people in black' which that mother had tried to spook her child with.\nThis isn't what she's meant to do. This isn't what she likes to do. She wants to do actual good work. She doesn't want to neglect her skills like this. She wants a new way out, but she still hasn't found the full resolve to take the step.\n\nThe young lord reaches out, brushes away the grime caking Kazemaru's pale hair, and hands her a contract termination, along with a business card for Rhodes Island.\nOne time when returning from work, an unsteady flowerpot was blown into the air, crumbs of soil and leaf fragments flying out to form a graceful arc, and the planter compacted with soil plummeted down and crashed straight onto Kazemaru's head.\nHead covered in soil and ceramic chips, Kazemaru was struck awake—she needed to leave. She had to leave.",

Didn't have a whole lotta practice swinging these tools around and nearly crippled myself, couldn't even walk.'\nThe doctor packaged the herbs along with the formula, carefully instructing the patient to mind the timing and frequency of taking the medicine.\nThe farmer sat on the ground and looked up at the mountains, saying: 'Doctor! I can reclaim half an acre of land a day, but there are so many mouths to feed in the village. If I want to free up the entire mountain to grow food for 'em all, even another century might not be enough!\n'Doctor, got any recipes that'd give me the long life and boundless strength of a burdenbeast? The whole village is counting on me!'\nThe doctor smiled with a furrowed brow, folding an extra corner in a medical tome. 'I'll see what I can do.'\n\nThe doctor traveled far and wide, and by the time she knocked on the doors of that small courtyard once more, several more tombstones were dotting the wilderness.\nThe farmer was sitting at the doorstep, holding a shriveled ear of wheat. His face had become wrinkled, his fist beating at his chest as he gasped for breath. 'The old burdenbeast passed on. The poor fella didn't even last as long as me.'\nThe doctor had seen this before. She said that he wasn't sick, only that he should avoid excessive exertion, before writing a few more prescriptions.\nThe farmer set the herbs aside: 'I wanna send my youngest to a nomadic city, where he'd have a better future. But, there ain't enough money here, not enough land.'\nHe grasped the reins of the newly-purchased young burdenbeast, and thought long and hard. 'Doctor, if I keep on farmin' like this, I don't think I'm gonna last very long... What do you reckon I do? If I'm gone, what's my kid gonna do? ...I don't suppose you could give me a few extra years?'\nThe doctor did not know what else to say; all she could do was take out a few pellets of medicine: 'These can either bolster your vitality, or...'\n\nWhen the doctor passed through countless fields, walked through villages and towns of all shapes and sizes, and heard all manner of prayers, she would think back to that gaunt, bony burdenbeast and the farmer goading it onward.\nThere were more people in the small courtyard than usual. The farmer was lying there on the bed, his sons and daughters holding his hands. Behind them stood <i>their</i> sons and daughters, looking at her as if imploring her to do something.\nThe doctor approached. 'You asked me before if there was a medicine that could grant you long life. I've made it, so if you take it now, you can still...'\nThe old man remained silent, his shrunken face finally moving: 'No need. How could something like that really exist? ...Doctor, you won't get any older, but even if I took it, it probably wouldn't do anything...'\nThe doctor followed his gaze outside the room. The seeds had only been half-sown, and the farmer's youngest son was still there, his legs covered in mud. The old farmer let out a sigh and closed his eyes, and the son began to cry softly.\n\nThe doctor stepped into the mountainous woods.\n'Is there no cure for old age?' Nobody answered, only the whispers of the mountains and trees, and the low cries of the fowlbeasts.\nThe wild mountain lotus spoke: 'There is no cure for old age. The search for immortality is but the pipe dream of nobles and aristocrats.'\n'Is there no cure for illness?'\nThe beastling spoke: 'Illness can be cured. All sentient beings seek only to be free of disease and disaster.'\nThe doctor turned around. The wild mountain lotus bloomed, the beastling lapped at water, but neither said a word.\nThe doctor then understood. 'Not for immortality, but to avert disaster. The people are suffering, and I shall only treat illness from now on.'",

She tugs on her collar, and continues to observe as sand blankets the land and sky outside, wondering what's going to happen once class is out.\nBrutal winds assail unabated, the sand within rattling and pattering against the glass with a great clamor. The long-bearded professor is forced to stop teaching, and wait for the noise to subside.\nAmidst the dense sandstorm, Tuye notices a buckthorn plant shuddering about beneath a dilapidated wall, a flower bud somehow still surviving on its sparse branches. Tender, frail, liable to fall away in the wind at any time.\n'Tch...' Tuye shuts her book and stuffs it in her bag, stooping low in preparation to slip out the back door.\n'It appears you think you've already grasped this. Am I wrong, Miss Tuye?'\n'Huh?!'\nTuye looks up, and sees the professor standing at his lectern, arms folded, giving her a look of annoyance.\n'What was I saying just now? Answer correctly and I won't deduct credits.' The old professor strokes his beard.\n'It's caused by the steam trap having an insufficient pressure differential, leading to steam leaking from the condenser.'\n'I hadn't gotten that far yet, Miss Tuye.'\n'You were about to, weren't you?' Tuye wiggles her eyebrows and lets out a smile.\nFaced with such an irrepressible student, the professor can only heave a sigh and give his begrudging reply.\n'Fine, get out of here. You're not helping me.'\n'What about my course credit?'\n'*sigh* Just this once, I'll let you off the hook.'\nClearing his throat, the professor is about to continue where he left off, when Tuye's next remark suddenly angers him to the point his beard stands on end.\n'You know, you can dock some if you really wanna—I'm way above a pass, anyhow.'\nTuye hoists her bag and is sprinting out of the door by the time she finishes, leaving only the hinges slowly shutting, and an ear-piercing grumble.\n'Get back here, you little goddamn lout!'\nThe professor's bellowing is loud enough to be heard outside the lecture hall, and fades away in the hallway along with Tuye's cackles.\nMany years later, Tuye still regularly thinks back to her student days and cracks a smile—to this day, she and the professor have unfailingly kept in touch by letter. And every time she finishes writing one, she takes the condenser still off her backpack and pours the water into the planter on the windowsill, where a lush and beautiful buckthorn grows.",

The fire rages on, and even when the skies open up, the rain can't even touch the flames before it steams away midair, leaving only the sound of crackling.\nBreaking the silence, someone asks Kestrel. 'Boss, how many did you kill today?'\n'Can't remember.'\n'Who would remember after the heat of battle how many they killed, youngster?' a weary voice adds. 'To survive is already a job well done.'\nKestrel lets the topic lapse, but that twisted face comes to mind. The one of an 'old acquaintance' scared shitless. The one she closed in on with every step. The one with no alternative but to jump from the roof. The one who left her only that face, one moment before melting into the sea of flames.\nShe knew who that was. The assassin who murdered her friend.\n'Still, this victory's worth celebrating. Today, we wiped out a few more of the killers who slaughtered our people.' Kestrel comes to a stop, looks back, sees the descendants she's brought along. The distant flames flicker in her eyes.\nThey raise a cheer, but Kestrel doesn't smile.\n'So how many killers to go?' asks again the one who broke the silence.\nKestrel gazes over. It's a girl, still young. If the tribe still was, she would never be part of these fighters. She would be living her youth, a bright one, a happy one.\nOh. That's right. She doesn't even have a 'tooth mark'.\n'You showed a great display today. I've now decided you should be rewarded with a 'tooth mark.' Kestrel fails to directly answer the girl's question. 'While we return, you can think about what style of mark you'd like.'\n'Really?'\nA feeling hits Kestrel. She's had this conversation. She was the girl before her. She, the girl, before the tribe's chief, the one who raised her—the one who was dearest to her, the one who outlined, over her left shoulder, the very first band of her 'tooth mark'.\nKestrel can't help but hug that shoulder tight, the warm memory almost abating the cold rainy eve, but it's only a moment before she comes to. For they, stood in the rain, are waiting for her.\n'Really—now let's get back to the gathering point quick. I'll find the box, and then you'll be able to choose.'\nThe group begins to slowly move, their figures gradually melting into the dark of night, never to be seen again.",

          "description": "Ho'olheyak needed to remove her complicated equipment in order to undergo her operator's entry medical examination. She also had to hand it over to the Engineering Department for routine checks.\nFirst came the exoskeleton on her back.\nThe dull thud it made upon touching the ground attested to its weight. It was a prototype developed by Raythean Industries, an exoskeleton weighing a hefty 95 kilograms. She had to employ Originium Arts to make it float; otherwise, she had no hope of donning it.\nThe exoskeleton carried an Arts amplification device and possessed some offensive capabilities in close combat. The boxes on their sides contained various necessities. Though it might seem cumbersome in certain situations, most of the time it provided more assistance than a hindrance. What was even more important was that it was modeled after the 'wings' of the ancestral 'K'uk'ulkan.' Her parents and ancestors all possessed a pair of these 'wings,' made from the sturdiest materials of their time. She couldn't possibly remove hers.\nNext was the outer coat.\nThis coat had been recently refurbished and used a new type of fiber developed by Volvort Kochinski, acquired through Maylander connections. Like the impenetrable skin of the K'uk'ulkan bloodline, the material of this outer coat was resistant to conventional weaponry.\nShe carefully detached the tubes connecting the outer coat and exoskeleton. These tubes circulated different fluids in various situations—nutrient solution, emergency medicine, and so forth. The K'uk'ulkan were powerful and solitary; she also had to be capable of handling most dangers alone.\nLastly, there was the staff.\nThe Arts Unit came from a secret laboratory beneath the Maylander Foundation, customized to complement her Arts. She delicately removed a small box from the top of the staff. She didn't care whether Rhodes Island could steal the Maylander technology contained in the staff, but within this tiny box lay centuries of K'uk'ulkan history.\n'Wings,' 'skin,' 'solitude'—these were their burdens, but also their pride. They believed that when they shed these false adornments, it marked the moment they returned to the most primal state of the K'uk'ulkan.\nAnd now, in an empty room, she stared at the box in her hand for a long time until an HR operator called her name.\nAfter a moment of contemplation, she didn't put the box away; instead, she pressed it into the outer coat and walked out of the room.",

She repeatedly requested his assistance in operations for no special reason, and even came to Engineering Department without permission just to be able to spend time with Friston-3 alone.\nAdditionally, Ho'olheyak has been spotted multiple times trying to reach the deepest levels of the ship recently by other operators.\nComment:\nI'll modify and upgrade Friston-3's facial expressions next, and all his work will be temporarily suspended. Report this Ho'olheyak situation to Kal'tsit. She will handle it accordingly.\n—Closure\n\nOperator Special Affairs Approval Procedure—HHY011\nThe day before, the Maylander Foundation sent us a formal cooperation invitation. Ho'olheyak took the initiative to approach HR and express her desire to become the project liaison, saying, 'Am I not the one person at Rhodes Island most familiar with the Maylander Foundation?' Considering the political background of the Foundation, as well as the impossible-to-ignore veiled threats within the inquiry, appointing a former defector as the liaison may create unnecessary tension. Furthermore, we must also consider Ho'olheyak's motivations. We cannot predict what actions she might undertake while trying to shake off any lingering influences from her former employer.\nComment:\nApproving Ho'olheyak's application. Maylander's interest in Rhodes Island is more or less because of her, so sending her will simplify things for us. Also, since she has been with us for quite some time now, we can afford her certain level of trust.\n—Kal'tsit\n\nOperator Special Affairs Approval Procedure—HHY020\nRegular targeted medical projects are underway. We've also established a team proficient in genetics, mysticism, and history, and everyone is enthusiastic. If only you'd join as well... The K'uk'ulkan clan performs a congenital surgery on its newborns—an act that, while perverse, is fortunately not completely untraceable. If we're able to eliminate the profound effects of the procedure from Ho'olheyak's body and psyche, the results would be absolutely groundbreaking across every field!\nBesides, time is running out, right? If what she said is true, the procedure will likely cause her death in her early forties, meaning she has only a few years to live. She might've once been a massive headache for us, but she's one of our operators now, and we can't just sit back and watch her die.\n—Warfarin\nComment:\nGranted.\n—Kal'tsit\n\nOperator Adaptability Assessment: Ho'olheyak\n'Operator Ho'olheyak seems to have well adapted to the daily life on Rhodes Island.'\n'Hey, don't you think that is even more dangerous?!'",

          "description": "Deszcz's 'The Conflict, Reconciliation, and Imagined Future of Kazimierz's Present Legislature with Regards to Trade Capital' is an incisively opined piece, fully and flawlessly expounded on, and combines depth of theory with practical value. It is, with no room for doubt, a superlatively written essay. But conferring on her the law school's honor of Outstanding Graduate was a decision I had to vie with some other teachers over.\nHaving taught for decades, we often see students with aspiration in their hearts, their hands faintly trembling against the cover of the Code they swear their oath on, their anticipation and resolution a burning light in their eyes. We also often see students who change course or lose their bearings midway; they ask why a prompt as absurd as 'A thief lacerates a victim's arm intending to intimidate; however, the victim suffers from aplastic anemia and soon passes away from blood loss. What criminal charges and sentencing would be appropriate?' would appear on the bar exam, and soon after are taken aback to find that in Kazimierz, what one learns, what is tested, and what one uses all stand completely on their own. Every clause in the code is well-defined yet unfortunately narrow, and cannot keep pace with the speed at which the arena and the commercial streets develop. The dispute between 'the means justify the ends' and 'the ends justify the means' exists only in the classroom, and in reality, practical law is much more dependent on interpretation, supplementation, and guidance by precedent-setting cases... its form in a vacuum being the true face of Kazimierz law. It's not an easy pill to swallow for us old-timers, to say nothing of the youth.\nDeszcz is a reasonably excellent student. I once advised her to remain at the school to further her studies; perhaps the additional knowledge and dialectical thought would polish her acute mind to possess greater wisdom. However, she was all but itching to unleash her ferocity in true combat. She'd already obtained a formal job offer from the Longrein Law Firm prior to writing this thesis. Before she went into the field, I went and greeted the fine lawyer who took her on, begging him to take care of this student did not yet understand a thing. But he said Deszcz had 'adapted' very well to the firm, had suggested a number of improvements that hit the nail on the head, and spurred headway on their lawsuits, so he exhorted me not to worry too much.\nDeszcz is too clever, and too uncompromising—this is the greatest thing separating her from most students. Her dedication to using law to seek the truth has supported her in achieving such excellent grades, but she has yet to prepare herself for 'being unable to find an answer.' As we all know, the more devout the believer, the more susceptible they are to falling into an even deeper emptiness when that belief crumbles. As teachers, we have no right to choose our students' paths forward. We can only be there behind them, to send them off and wish them well.\nIt's my hope that she doesn't become simply the next youth to lose their way amidst the Grand Knight Territory's resplendent neons.\n......\n\n—Extracted from a speech made by Deszcz's mentor, Professor Łobacz, at the internal evaluation conference for the school's Outstanding Graduates",

A Notarial Hall executor?!'\n'Yes.'\n......\nNo matter the reason Ezell gives, the patisserie owner finds it hard to comprehend why an executor wants to do this of all things. Still, Laterano's Sankta are famed for doing as they please, and he has no reason to refuse, so the patisserie is where he lets Ezell be.\nAt first, Ezell's work is rough around the edges, clearly too stiff in copying what he sees. He unfailingly takes down all the necessary ingredients, amounts, ratios, and methods in his notebook.\nSome, of course, are floored to recognize what Ezell is. There's even speculation that some major case is developing—why else would a Notarial Hall executor go into hiding here, like this? Still, the week ends without anything of note. And just like at the Notarial Hall, Ezell is never late. But no matter how busy the shop is, he never works overtime, always punctual to clock out.\n'Cecelia, I'm home. Here, cookies.'\n'Thanks, Mister Ezell!'\n'They're really good! Mister Ezell, did you make them?'\n'Mm-hm. In a few more days, once I've made the preparations, we'll head out to see your papà.'\n'Okay!'\n......\n'What? You're quitting, right now? *sigh* You've put so much effort into learning patisserie, you know. Even taught you my secret recipe, hahaha.'\n'I'm sorry.'\n......\n'Ezell, the intel you need's all here.'\n'Thank you, Richele.'\n'Once you're checked in at Rhodes Island, got an idea of where you're going next?'\n'Hmm... based on our present intel, I think I do, roughly.\n'Let's go, Cecelia.'\n......\nIf you took a look through the notebook Ezell carries, you'd find it crammed full of things you'd expect from someone like him. Notes on his work, timetables, coffee brewing instructions, etc.\nBut on one page, in immature handwriting, is 'I want to eat Lateran sweets,' contrasted by a dessert recipe below in Ezell's script.\n'They'd be hard to find in any stores after leaving Laterano, and would spoil on the way if prepared in bulk beforehand, so the best plan was to learn to make them myself.'\n'I know how implausible leaving Laterano to find a Sarkaz is, given the current circumstances. I have enough faith to stay by Cecelia's side the whole way, but I know that for her, the journey to come will reveal itself to be an ordeal like nothing else.'\n'So I've told her that whenever she wants to do something, she can write in this book. No matter how unrealistic, I'll earnestly plan it out, execute it, and achieve it. So that on this journey, Cecelia's heart remains ever filled with hope.'\nThus explains Ezell.\n'Ah! Cecelia, wait!'\n'That's black coffee! You won't grow big if you drink that!'",

          "description": "Horn sat up against a tree. A shell had punched a hole through its trunk. The breeze passed through the decaying wood, giving off a mournful sound like some sort of crude instrument.\nAt least it was quieter than the battlefield. Horn was about to rest for a while, but found herself approached as soon as she closed her eyes. 'Here ye are, Captain!' Bagpipe leaned on the officer, her chin resting on her shoulder. Finding it too heavy, Horn tried to pull away, but Bagpipe's Vouivre strength was too great. 'Took me ages to find you,' Bagpipe batted her eyelashes, her tone pitiable, 'Ages and ages.'\nMaybe she was just too tired, she fell sleep. Horn felt guilty about it. As leader of Tempest Platoon, she shouldn't have left her people to go off for a nap. How was the battle going? Had Triangle's recon team returned? Was Bagpipe's injury bothering her? A pile of questions clogged her throat. Footsteps and laughter sounded from behind. Oboe was probably telling bad jokes again, Cello laughed a little later than the others but always the loudest, slapping Oboe's shoulder until he begged for mercy. Bagpipe finally let go of Horn's arm, hopped up, and waved vivaciously to her platoonmates.\nHorn wanted desperately to turn around, but she couldn't. She knew deep down that behind her was nothing but a hole. She couldn't turn around. If she did, those voices would vanish.\n'What sort of dream were you having?' Rosalie's voice dripped with her usual teasing tone, 'Wouldn't hurt to let me take first place once in a while, would it? You're so tired you're out as soon as you hang your head. How unlike you.'\nHorn saw the closed book beside her, with a thin green pen stuck inside. Rosalie had recently taken up felting on the grounds that it relieved the stress of finals. She insisted the tan ball in her hand was Horn's head. Horn repeatedly countered that her hair was a platinum blonde, but Rosalie didn't listen.\n'What did you dream about? The war again?' Rosalie put down her unfinished felt, tapping her chin curiously, 'What does the future look like in your dreams? I'm still thinking about what I might do after graduation. Logistics seems a bit boring. Perhaps I'll be a staff officer? Ooh, I wonder what my first fight will be like? I'll have to count these leisurely days while I still can.'\nUnfortunately, time waits for no woman. The half-finished felt lay on the ground, having turned a muddy color. Horn couldn't guess how Rosalie might craft her face, and she'll never get a chance to find out. She couldn't even remember clearly what Rosalie looked like. The friends had always liked to sit in the brightest places, her bright green hair, her smug smile, they all melted in the fiery sunlight.\nA pair of rough hands landed on Horn's face. She recalled how every time she napped under the maple tree in the yard, her grandmother would walk over and fan her, relieving the heat of the sun and shooing away the flies. This was still a dream, certainly, but this time she was lucid, and she had no intention of opening her eyes. She used to bother her grandmother for stories about the army, her great-great grandfather, and the feats of White Wolves past. Then, she dreamed of fighting for Victoria, just like her ancestors. Now that the war had truly begun, her dreams turned to her grandmother fanning her.\nSteady and strong, the rhythm was more comforting than sleep itself. Horn opened her eyes, and Feist gave her an apologetic smile. He didn't want to wake her with his work. Her shield needed maintenance too. Horn lowered her head and a gust of wind blew by, tiny buds falling from the trees, covering the mottled shield.\nSo, the cannonfire hadn't totally killed her tree after all.",

I was gonna whip you up a manual, but Stainless provided the parts, and his two cents are to forget about introducing this drone in writing, so I recorded you a video instead! First, you gotta open...'\nRockrock comes to Rhodes Island's training grounds and, following Closure's guidance, pilots this sudden and impromptu gift. The drone nimbly sweeps through simulated battlefront, casting its tiny shadow on the floor.\nExcellent acceleration, excellent turn speed, excellent climb and descent speed, minimal handling delay, stable hovering. It's a fine enough combat drone already. But Rockrock has a hunch that it could be made even better. Call it a keen eye when it comes to manufactured products; call it the high standards of an excellent technician.\nHeading back to her dorm, she disassembles her present. In the process, she gasps with marvel more than once at its design. Only the best of the best craftwork could have created its structural chassis, with a state-of-the-art console clearly responsible for the precision cutting. Its control system's cable management looks 100% orderly, every last hair of savable space saved. The design itself was likely engineered with her piloting habits in mind. Still, the issue might lie exactly here—in the greedy pursuit of lightweight structural configuration, its cutting-edge energy sources can't output its full potential... Rockrock doesn't understand. Why would Closure design it this way?\nAfter carefully inspecting all over, she's astonished to find a tiny little box crammed into the drone's chassis, with all the parts and wiring routing around it. It's as if the designer expressly scooped out a region from an already lightweight skeleton... Opening the box to take a look, she finds a note scrawled with little pictures of both Closure and her—'To Rockrock from Closure!'\nLooking at the note, a wordless feeling wells up within her. It's the implicit trust that exists only between artisans—I just knew you'd find the real gift. And after extracting this second surprise, the drone's internals become a new present unto themselves—how to reconfigure them to fill this empty portion? Just tweak the motor parts? Or reshuffle the placement of each part completely? Rockrock sinks into obsessed pondering.\nAnd not to forget... where should she put her own hidden present, for the next time she runs into Closure and Feist?",

          "description": "A shard of Kjerag ice crystal. Chestnut found himself comfortably seated in a baby carrier on a burdenbeast, snugly wrapped in a coat he 'rented' from a shopkeeper. Well, the smallest size fit him like a trailing robe, prompting the generous shopkeeper to let him keep it for free. Upon reaching the summit at dawn, golden sunlight filtered through the ice crystal onto his face. Lifted high by the jubilant crowd, he basked in their cheers.\nA piece of Rim Billiton pyrite. Coming to observe the geysers, Chestnut was greeted with an unexpected subterranean eruption followed by a mine collapse. Amid the chaos, he pushed through the fleeing masses, brandishing his medical license as he advanced against the current. After a long night of aid, he declined the grimy coins offered by the grateful miners, accepting instead a pristine piece of pyrite.\nA fossilized tree root from Sami. Traveling aimlessly to the far north, Chestnut clutched the fossil and sought a local diviner. They interpreted the ancient tree root, hidden for millennia, to say: 'The expansive land surpasses your wildest dreams. Never cease your journey.'\nAn uncut jade from Yan. At a bustling food stall, Chestnut used money pawned from the jade to treat two feuding groups of youths to local delicacies. Post-meal, the young men reconciled, chipped in for the jade back. If only all conflicts could resolve so straightforwardly, thought Chestnut, wishing to heal rather than witness needless strife.\nA chunk of amber. In Columbia, Chestnut stumbled upon a piece of amber encasing an insect. Earthspirit and Eyjafjalla scrutinized it, revealing that the creature hailed from Sargon, mystified at its presence in Columbia. They stood on the Rhodes Island landship, traversing the desert towards Sargon's boundless sands.\nChestnut pocketed the amber, realizing it was time to return home.\nBack underground, he revisited the familiar stone falls. Clumps of fluorescent mushrooms adorned the moist rock faces. Chestnut stood on his toes, measuring himself against the fungi. Little heads clustered around, eager for tales of his surface stories.\nA line of ore lamps shed gentle light on curious gazes, reminiscent of his childhood days, though now he was the storyteller. Chestnut grinned.\n'Every one of these minerals come from distinct landscapes. Which story would you like to hear first?'",

Whenever he did, he did so for the whole day. Jordi had carefully chosen his position, and watching from this angle at sunset, the sinking sun in the west would line up with the tip of the lighthouse for the briefest moment, like this tiny little lighthouse too had come alight.\nRegrettably, it was a fleeting scene, and in the span of a few short breaths, the lighthouse statue would once again go out. Everything about it would be rapidly shrouded in shadow, engulfed by darkness. What he had just witnessed was much like an illusion, gone without a trace.\nFortunately, the sun would rise as it did before the next day, and the lighthouse would come alight again. Just for a moment, of course.\nOn the day of his ninth birthday, Jordi decided to do something big. He wanted to grab hold of something more lasting. He'd try and see for himself what the town's elder workers were so proud of yet kept so secret, see for himself the colossal structure the parents he'd never met had disappeared in, see for himself that true 'Eye of Iberia.' Jordi began to climb the statue in the plaza, believing as long as he stood on its top, he'd be able to see the true rays of the lighthouse piercing through the fog. He clambered inch by inch, hearing the passersby in the plaza shrieking frantically, but the top was right there before him, he just had to make one final leap...\nJordi suddenly felt himself falling—the protrusion he'd used as footing likely crumbled—but why he was falling was no longer important. Jordi had struggled so he could cast his sight far away. Even if it was only for a split-second, he wanted to see it.\nNothing. There was nothing. The fog was like a gauze, covering all upon the surface of the sea.\nWhen Jordi came to, he was already back at home, his leg bandaged, the scent of meat porridge pervading the room. Hearing the sound of Jordi turning over, Thiago poked his body out of the kitchen. Jordi thought he'd be in for a ferocious scolding, but Thiago simply stared at him for a moment, let out a sigh, and pointed in the direction of the desk. There was laid a spyglass, glittering in alluring bronze.\nThat was a bygone affair, years and years ago, and now the scar has even faded. Only the small town's plaza seems to have been overlooked by time, resting unchanged. Jordi sits in his younger self's most favorite spot. Now he's seen the true Eye of Iberia, yet he can no longer sit on this bench with his uncle, listening to those heart-racing stories, taking turns at the spyglass through which they'd gaze far away.\nBut even with the help of a spyglass, they still couldn't see anything. It was the one thing the two of them silently, tacitly, never mentioned to each other.",

          "description": "To the Inquisition has come an Ægir.\nI can assure you, not for the past thirty years... no, forty, at the very least! Has an Ægir set foot in the Inquisition's court in any capacity other than that of the tried. The very words themselves are preposterous.\nIt was a young man, not particularly remarkable at first glance. Of fair height, but didn't stand too straight or firm. His features were proper, but lacked any good presence. In all regards, not someone especially worth minding. If it weren't for the fact he was an Ægir, I think even someone new like myself wouldn't have batted an eye at him, with how unassuming and overt his arrival was.\nBut now, all the Inquisition is abound with the rumor of this Ægir.\nSome say he's some wicked convict's bosom friend, merely held temporarily in custody, but this young man—before I forget, his name is Jordi Fontanarossa—clearly has no restrictions placed on his movements. Others believe he's a signal from Lord Carmen that the Inquisition is once again to admit and even promote some of the Islanders in due time. However, Jordi Fontanarossa himself is feeble and weak, and his education lacking. At best, he would be capable of some meager secretarial work, and it doesn't seem as if his position is particularly lofty.\nGiven our workplaces are so near each other, I've had the opportunity to observe him.\nThis Ægir punches in at twenty minutes before his shift each morning, sometimes a little later, but he's never tardy. He's prone to occasional clumsiness; he once caused a misprint of documents after poorly operating the press, wasting quires of business paper. If I hadn't chanced to pass by and stop the machine, who knows how his accident could have evolved.\nI wasn't going out of my way to help him, of course, simply taking responsibility for our work. And no matter how I explained to him as such, the Ægir just persisted with his smile. He'd clearly misunderstood something! Such a loathsome smile!\nOne time, in relation to a vital operation, some colleagues and I were working overtime into the night. The Ægir brought a bucket of drinks over, telling us it was some herbal tea he'd mixed himself. I wasn't interested in having any, but that sort of thing <i>is</> effective at keeping one awake, so for the sake of work, it would have to do.\nIt was about early morning by the time we were done with overtime, and everyone was audibly starving, running on bellies filled with nothing but tea. There in the dark, I suddenly heard footsteps approach, then saw someone had lit a lantern. It was that Ægir, who himself hadn't left for some reason, and had a pot in his hands too, with several bags clearly filled with food hanging from his wrists.\n'Ah, are you all done with work? You must be exhausted.'\nThe man seemed all too apologetic as he regarded us. 'I'm sorry I couldn't be of help with any of it. All I could do was make some food that'd be light on the stomach...'\nWith no patience for hearing out his habitual self-debasement and humbling excuses, I took his pot without any fanfare.\nIt was a vanilla porridge, and all signs pointed to it being yet another recipe beneficial to health.\nLord Carmen having taken in this Ægir as a disciple? Absolutely never would I lend credence to such a ridiculous rumor. That said, based on what I've seen, should the Inquisition decide it <i>would</i> readmit Islanders, I suppose it would hardly be a bad thing.",

Not long ago, this was a battlefield where the village's guerrilla forces fought the invaders for control of the land. Sargon's colonial rule over Minos is now merely history, and the small invasion force has left this land that did not belong to them.\n'The brave archer repelled the enemy and became a hero admired far and wide. She also won the national archery championship. Then she returned to her hometown, settling into a life with her farm and garden... No, this ending is too bland. How can a tale of heroic adventure end so simply?'\nThe forest is quiet, and Erato's murmured storytelling is the only sound to be heard. The stiff bowstring vibrates, producing a faintly melodious sound. Several fowlbeasts settle in to form an audience, landing on the branches beside her, as well as her shoulders.\nErato looks south and sighs. The starlight above her head filters through layers of branches, leaving only a faint light. The vast sea of trees blocks the wind blowing in from the distance.\n'They say that the land beyond this forest is an endless desert. The invaders they expelled came from that desert.'\n'Life in places without grass and flowers must be difficult. But why is our world like this? Some places are full of flowers and grass, while others are barren?\n'Maybe the gods were lazy when shaping the lands, and in some places, they sculpted meticulously, creating mountains and lakes full of flowers and grass. In others, they just scribbled, resulting in desert and tundra. Because they live in such different environments, people in different places cannot understand each other, bringing about all manner of conflict... What do you think?'\nOf course, the fowlbeasts do not answer, they only take the flowers from Erato's hairpins and bring them back to their nests.\nErato proceeds with this opening, telling her story while playing and singing. From the hero leaving her hometown to the adventures on the road, meeting like-minded friends and teaching lessons to villains. By the time the story reaches 'The brave archer finally came to the place where the land ends and shot an arrow at the lazy creator god hiding there,' the last fowlbeast had fallen asleep by her side.\nErato jumps down from the tree branch and lands on the soft grass.\n'I should go and see for myself. Maybe I can find a similar story in my travels.'",

I felt something was different about you. I can see now—it really is you, Graf Urtica!'\nThe man's forehead is rife with sweat, his voice dramatically lowered.\n'I know you. You're just biding your time, waiting.'\n'You have the wrong person.'\n'Impossible! Look at these—Haguenau's inherited dice and wand, which went missing along with him twenty years ago! He and I grew up together! He told me himself that they were bestowed on his family by the Emperor!'\n'Haguenau? ...I'm not familiar.'\n'But I know what these are! Nobody else could have used them as weapons,' the man pants, 'and you have no idea what I went through afterward! Everyone said I was tainted by Haguenau's madness, shunned me, but Haguenau was never mad. And neither was I! I even caught Oripathy thanks to their backstabbing—I lost my land and family estate. I fell from being a well-to-do squire to this sorry state!'\n'You have my sympathies—'\n'No! That was nothing! They were crueler still, a hundred times over!'\n'A hundred times? Just what did they do to you?'\n'They dared to slip my only daughter some kind of drug, and she disobeyed me, you understand? She went and married a filthy commoner, even had a bastard child! Can you imagine such disgrace? One worse than death? Would you truly permit such a scandal if it were you?!'\n'......'\n'I beg you, take me as a retainer! Take me back to that age, to when we controlled with fear, when we made the petty thieves who dared question you shudder in despair! To when we could drive such presumptuous thoughts from the commoners' minds!'\n'Of course, I would gladly accept any treatment, be it favor or reprimand! I would fear you as though every day were my last! I would serve you, heed your every command! Should you call for my life to—'\nEbenholz sighs the heaviest sigh, gathers the dice in the hollow of his palm, and presents them to the man.\n'Very well, you will become my retainer here and now, with this secret ritual. Close your eyes and listen well.'\nThe man's entire body trembles with excitement.\n'Fick der Graf Urtica.'\n'?!'\n'Fick all die Kaiser, fick all die Kurfürsten, die Herzöge, die Grafen, die Barone—as well as you, Herr Knappe, or should I say, Herr Ex-Knappe.'\nThe man's expression gradually twists.\n'Wake up. No more living your dreams of superiority.'\n'You've lost your land, so do as the prideful commoner does and lift your head, puff out your chest, and live on.'\n'That is the one and only word of advice I'll give you.'",

          "description": "An Engineering operator, his beard slightly white, handed me my custom-order set of casting equipment. Its appearance was exactly as I'd requested: a simple metal case with not a hint of adornment, a wand with the surface polished to a mirror sheen, and a spherical energy reserve unit in a full silver color. Freshly produced, the Originium circuitry gave off the smell of solvent.\nI picked up the wand from the case, and the reserve smoothly floated up with it, responding to the wand's movements, resting into a stable orbit in the air some thirty or forty centimeters from my hand.\nI fired the reserve out, and the red circle bullseye at the center of the alloy was dented inwards by it. Impeccable energy conversion efficiency.\nThe Engineering operator's and my expressions were in total accord. We understood what a masterpiece this was.\n\nSome months later, I met him again, bringing my old wand with me, and some Originium dice in my pocket.\n'Old shoes do fit easier,' he remarked.\nI could only shrug.\n'Still, I'd like to know why you went back to your old equipment,' he said, his gaze sharp behind his goggles. 'Even if it's just cosmetic reasons—no skin off my nose. Call it a little after-sales service courtesy of Engineering.'\n'Because of... the noise.'\n'Noise?'\nI simply pulled out my wand and give it a perfunctory wave. The tip streaked through the air, but what came was not the sound of slicing air, but music.\n'I did some research into your wand there, when we got your request. The frequencies it vibrates against the air at are beyond common sense, I can tell you that. It's a real mystery, but it doesn't do anything to help casting. Doesn't hinder either, though.'\n'I understand, but this ties to my—'\nMy personal affairs.\nI ordered the wand precisely to distance myself from that bothersome music. It and the fantastical melody that once played at the Afterglow Hall are all but the same. For each day that I use the wand, that night I dream of that scene again, and hear that melody.\nThe new wand successfully quietened my dreams, but the scene still laid before me, the silent struggle all the more wretched, the silent death throes all the more terrible.\nOnly once I took up my old wand again did I understand. That nightmare would run its way through my entire life—had already done so—and to try and forget was mere futility.\nI couldn't flee it, and couldn't reconcile with it either. I was forced to concede that it was a part of me, and that I would fight it for the rest of my days.\nAs now well demonstrated. I was the one who ordered the wand, and the one who gave up on it.\nGraf Urtica simply walked away from it all, and left all the trouble and anger to others, but Ebenholz could not.\nOf course, Ebenholz could denounce those morons who thought themselves so lofty; however, faced with a craftsman who he'd offended, did he truly have the right to send them packing with but a few vile words?\nIf it were... him, what would he do? What would he want me to do?\nThe answer couldn't be any clearer.\nWith difficulty, I cleared my throat, unsure if I would offend the craftsman once again with this.\n'The story is a little long, but... if you're willing to listen, I can explain in full detail.'",

          "description": "'Are you that attached to this place?'\nSunlight streams in through the window, glass filtering it clean of its warmth, turning it as frigid and dirty as the panes.\n'This parlor is just as I remember it—not very big. The only difference is, the mold is ever ranker now, isn't it?\nEbenholz paces through the deserted parlor. The expensive furnishings that once filled it have now either been stolen to sell by retainers fleeing the spire, or simply left behind due to their sheer value. He spies that someone tried to move the excessively large piano, but gave up for whatever reason, their attempt having left a visible scratch on the floorboards. Comical, and loathsome. The walls are thick with dust and mildew, no longer showing any sign of the patterns beneath. The only familiar sight is the fireplace sunk into the wall. The timbers' ashes lie under a fresher layer of grime, but they're still there in the hearth, just as Ebenholz had left them.\n'It's been a long while since you left, and no one's lit the fireplace in the meantime, hence the dust and rot. That's been the story of this room, yes, ever since you left.'\nEbenholz approaches the fireplace. He can still almost remember how it used to burn. There was a fire here. There was warmth. Now, though, it is an ugly yawning chasm, and all he finds in its maw is darkness. Ebenholz lifts a hand to brush away the stale air, and refreshes himself if only for a moment.\n'Will that even help? Five seconds, ten, and the foul air will fill your nostrils once more.'\nEbenholz draws his wand. The Originium dice float, circling in a steady orbit, letting off light and heat.\n'Of course you could do that. Raise a gust of wind, summon a ball of fire, those are simple feats for you. They can blow away the dust, burn off the rot. You've tried as such before. You've seen some results.'\nSilent, Ebenholz puts away his wand, and the Originium dice fall back into his hand. He bends over, the darkness inside the fireplace staring out at him.\n'But they always come back, don't they? You can resist, you can refuse, you can do everything you can to keep the darkness at bay. You've contended with it all for far too long. You can choose to brush away the miasma, you can choose to leave Urtica, you can choose to hide, and the further the better. Light your glimmering lights until you lose count, but you will never keep the long night from becoming day.'\nEbenholz reaches into the ashes, and pulls out a wizened branch, not wholly consumed.\n'Decay will keep creeping over this parlor with endless arms, until it clambers into your mind and body, just as it ate at your parents, and all the masters of this spire before them.'\n'No!' In an instant, the dizziness born from the depths of his brain takes hold of his entire consciousness. Ebenholz's vision blurs. The voice sneers, loudly and clearly.\nFrom the scorched branch protrudes a bud, just as black and burnt, and it pierces through Ebenholz's palm, and winds about his wrist, binding his arm. It grows thorns, pricking his skin, stabbing into his marrow. Fresh blood springs forth, trickling down the branch's length, falling into the darkness and mingling with the embers.\n'Urtica's veins are the branches of the dark. The decay and withering are nigh. You cannot break free.'\nEbenholz opens his eyes. The branch is not in his hand; his arm has landed in a layer of fine ash. No wounds, the blood still flowing beneath his skin. The beating of his pulse seems to suggest all that happened just now was an illusion. An illusion—I want no more illusions.\n'No.' Ebenholz finally breaks his silence. 'I know decay and withering will take Urtica's every branch and leaf. I know that so long as your soul still lingers throughout my body, this nightmare will never end.\n'But this rot, this shambling corpse of trite rhetoric, has lingered for too long now.'\nEbenholz stares back into the dark within the fireplace. The charred branch lies upon the embers there, stained with fresh blood, permeating the black soil. Its blood seeps into the cracks, with first heat, then a spark, and then flashes are crackling about the branch's tip. In an instant, they gather together into a black flame, engulfing the entire branch. Once more, the embers begin to burn.\n'So it will conclude. So it will end, full stop.'\nThe fireplace is lit with a flame blacker than the dark itself, the glow from the charred branch filling the whole parlor. The voice finally ceases to jeer, ceases to respond.\n'How about I go meet that so-called Austere Authority for myself.'",

          "description": "An ear-bleeding klaxon pierces the night, a girl shaken from her dream.\nSand flies about the base's entire perimeter, the storm beating violently against every door and window. Subconsciously, the girl thinks to call for her mother, but remembers none of the Pioneer grown-ups are in the base right now, out on their exploration missions.\nA massive boom. The roof of the temporary living quarters is battered.\nMalevolent yellow monsters close in. The girl cannot run, only shrink back into the corner of her bed. From deep underground, up floats a silver light that lands upon her cheek, very much like her mother's hand would.\nThe girl hugs her mother's storybook tight. She recalls her telling tale after tale. From those gentle passages, she strives to draw some courage.\nThe storm curls through layer upon layer of sand. Brighter grows the silver light, which transforms into a gleaming ribbon and gently lifts the girl up.\nInto a silver dreamland she falls. In this cool yet warming reverie, she flies on moonlight, the storm and monsters never to catch up.\n'...how is she now?'\n'Vital signs normal. She's been spooked a little, but she'll be awake real soon.'\n'Do you think those waves of abnormal energy just now...'\n'Earliest Pioneer records say this silver stuff's a special material that goes by the name of 'Transmitter,' developed by a scientist who joined a Pioneer Team voluntarily. Pioneers liked to call it 'Silver Slippers,' because it always helped anyone in trouble get home.'\n'Wasn't that... back when this frontier first got broken in, all those years ago? I honestly thought it was just a legend.'\n'Nope. It's real.' Atop the sickbed, the girl opens her eyes. 'Mom...'\n'Mommy's right here.'\n'Mom, where'd she go? The one who owned the 'Silver Slippers'...'\nHer mother is silent for a moment, before resolving to tell the girl the truth.\n'If the records are true, then she did live here. But nobody knows where she went after that. Maybe she went missing on some deep delve, or maybe... she went of her own will, onto the next frontier, and the one after that, ever further out.'\nThrough the girl's eyes flashes a brief sense of disappointment. But very shortly, she catches sight of the storybook by her bedside, and springs up, grabbing it and hugging it close to her chest.\n'I get it, Mom. She's the same as the hero in the storybook you gave me, right?'\n'The... the girl who's always journeying on?'\n'Yeah, she's my favorite!'\n'Apparently, its author was an early Pioneer too. Who was based on what, we can't be sure...'\n'It's real.' The girl's eyes twinkle with light. 'She'll see her family again, and she can make dreams real, because I know it. She's just like me.'",

          "description": "During the siege and looting carried out by the Reunion Movement, Operator Absinthe tried several times to contact the garrison outside the city for support. She also attempted to call her father, whose whereabouts were unknown, but never received a response, only the murmur of pale despair. It was like holding a candle in the dark, unable to see the way forward or find the way back, but still persistently believing in the false, icy hope she gripped.\nAccording to Operator Absinthe's recollection, she thought she heard her father's voice from her communication device just as she was about to fall unconscious. She sprung up in surprise and luckily avoided Reunion forces passing by. However, the message was too short for her to even confirm whether it was a real voice or a hallucination brought on by fear, hunger, and despair.\n\nAfter coming to Rhodes Island, Operator Absinthe persists in attempting to contact her father through the communication device when there is no one around, as if he is silently listening to the other end.\n'Dad, are you there? They took me to a place called Rhodes Island. They say it's safe here... I hope it's true.'\n'Dinner was tough today, but I still ate a lot.'\n'I started training at Rhodes Island, with Instructor Dobermann... Err, she's my teacher. She says I'm doing well, but... I know she's just encouraging me to keep going...'\n'I'm going on missions with other operators here soon, but I don't know how well I'll do...'\n'I noticed my pants looked short today. I think I'm getting taller, Dad.'\n'Dad, are you listening...?'\n...\n\n'Regarding the phenomenon of hearing her father's voice from the communication device, Operator Absinthe comes close to bringing it up to the medical operators during her psychological treatments. With different memory fragments overlapping and pieced together, and according to information collected later in Chernobog, our assessment is that this communication may have really occurred, but it very likely did not come from Absinthe's father's comm. Rather, it was a Reunion transmission. When the mob located and assaulted the location where the remaining civilian police officers had taken refuge, Absinthe's father's voice was picked up in the ensuing chaos.'\n'As for why an Ursus police communicator received a Reunion signal, the most likely explanation is channel interference, calling for no further inquiry.'\n'The above medical record will be expunged today.'",

He'd rather jump off the ship than turn in this design for a New Zeruertzan landmark as it is!\nHe averts his eyes from it as fast as he can. Like it or not, he made that model himself, and it burns him—it leers at him. <i>What now, proud architect?</i> Tasking him with 'fun' was an exercise in self-defeat.\n'I can't do it.'\nCan't he defend his dignity in any way? He dithers in circles, growing all the more agitated. No, now he feels like he's being lassoed along. He once chased after his departed 'design representative' with all the same agitation, and the harder he held on, the harder that title threatened to tear him in two. Like his right leg, the responsibility stung relentlessly: a reminder of how short his life was, how every standstill was a step forever lost.\nHe can't stop now.\nHe roots around everywhere he can, dying for some flash of inspiration to save him. Sketches fly into the air, models tumble to the ground, and still... still no eureka moment. He claws at his head in annoyance, and then, he comes face to face with the very last thing in the room.\nA barrel of berry tomato wine.\nFrom Catch. His fellow Durin are all big drinkers—where they're concerned, booze and fun more or less go hand in hand. Still, he recalls his mentor languidly staring out the window at the dome from time to time, sitting with a glass at the table.\nHe resists the idea, but the thought of trying is hard to stifle once it surfaces. He strains to pry the barrel open, then fills a glass. The scent of it actually stuns him for a moment. His reflection in it ripples with memory.\n'If you're curious, you may as well try.'\nHe did as his mentor said, accepting the bottle proffered and pouring the entire thing. The fierce bite of it made him dizzy, threatening to write off the rest of his workday. He scratched at the tiny rocks on his right leg as hard as he could, just hoping the pain would keep him sober still.\nBut his mentor laughed at that.\n'Enjoying life is our finest trait, and what we founded our homeland on. You're no exception, Stitch. You'll understand one day.'\nHearing that voice from long ago wakes him back up. He's startled to find himself reclining carefree in his chair, glass in hand just like Catch and his mentor and all the other Durin, quietly gazing out the cabin window. He subconsciously moves to scratch at his leg's stones, but his hand freezes.\nHe has no throbbing pain beneath the stones. He didn't feel it when he eyed the wine barrel. He hasn't felt it for a long, long time now.\n'Gavial, finally! He's been hiding in his studio forever!'\n'Alright, alley-oop—'\nThe door bursts open, and Gavial's fist stops just a finger's width from his nose.\n'Gavial? Perfect timing. Take me to the Medical Department—it's time for my treatment. What are you all staring at?'\nGavial gawks at the model rec facilities on the table behind him, a simple and surefire crowd-pleaser. Also, the bare and empty glass. It all clicks in her head, and a smile creeps onto her face.\n'Gavial! Why are you hitting me? I was NOT drinking before my appointment! I poured it all back!'",

The earth's color.\nThe color furthest from print, and closest to truth.\nThe color I once fled, and was forced to face again.\nBut ink's color, too.\nTo this day, I only hope that black ink may let me portray some few of this land's darknesses.",

They were in need of an archer, and I believe I can fill that role.\n'We'll be traveling through a vast desert, then on through layers of towering forest, and ultimately arrive at a northern city.\n'It's a snowy place, and even wearing several layers, you'll still shiver from that winter cold.\n'I can make new friends there, and save enough money to buy a huge house to share with my loved ones.\n'I should get out of here. It's too hot, everyone's always sweating.\n'Life's pretty boring, too. The only thing there is to do is chase the animals around every day.\n'I believe I'm meant for more. What do you think?'\nHe swung the arrow a few times before nocking it gently into the bow.\nThe arrow flew off into the distance, beyond the reach of his sight.\n\n'You should get out of here,'\nHe bowed his head and refused to answer as he continued chopping wood with his axe.\n'In a few days, a group of mercenaries will come, and they are in need an archer. I think you're perfect for the job.\n'You'll travel through a vast forest, traverse fields of waving wheat, and ultimately arrive at a small town in the south.\n'It rarely snows there, and the trees stay green, even in winter. It's warm enough wear only a single layer of clothing.\n'You'll make new friends there, save some money, and maybe even find a lady to spend your life with.\n'You shouldn't stay here. It's too cold, and snowstorms come in the winter.\n'Look around you. There's nothing to do here. The only thing that comes close is hunting.\n'I believe you're meant for more. What do you think?'\nHe weighed the axe in his hand and carefully placed it atop the pile of wood. He remained silent and merely rubbed his teeth against his lip. He kept at it for a while, enjoying the sweet, tangy taste in his mouth.\nFinally, he spoke.\n'No, I'm fine here. I should stay.'\n'What are you even staying for?'\n'I'm waiting.'\n'For what?'\nHe fell silent again. He had no answer to this question.\nFor the storms to subside? For the snow to melt?\nOr maybe only for an arrow, shot by a young boy, to break the bounds of time and space, with the courage of ignorance and naive bravado, tearing through the layers of his life's disguises, to pierce his very heart.\nThen, his heart would shatter, only to light up once more, filled with warmth anew.",

          "description": "It took a disembodied hand flying past her head for Lavinia to snap out of it.\nJust a few hours ago, she'd concluded her first ever trial of Famiglia matters.\nEver since she decided to walk this path, she'd heard of—and experienced—many a Famiglia's interference with the justices. Some around her had even gone missing by now.\nBut she stayed her course. After all, she'd long prepared herself mentally. These troubles could not trounce her; in fact, the more they cropped up, the more she believed she had to change this status quo.\n—All until she finished her work for the day, and entered the alley where she had parked her vehicle.\nIt was then that she thought she should drop in tomorrow to see the man who'd supported her taking this path, to tell him how she hadn't let him down. And on the other hand she thought, perhaps, that that would make her seem too much a pushover; maybe something sterner was called for. After all, should his own Famiglia fall afoul of a lawsuit themselves, she could only be impartial.\nIf not for that familiar hand pulling her down, her head may well have been skewered by the bolt.\nShe felt her own thoughts halt, leaving her staring blankly at the hand's owner—Bernardo stood in her way, taking out each figure that rushed her one by one.\nAnd only once she snapped out of it did she finally realize the gulf between what she'd heard and pictured, and experiencing it personally.\nA momentary silence descended on the alley, at which point Bernardo gave the underlings to his rear a nod, and they brought out a box half her size.\nBernardo opened it, and within, there laid a metal gauntlet with a hammer shackled to it. Under the dusk streetlamps, their gold luster almost stung the eye, but what hurt most about them to see was the circle of thorns winding about the glove.\n'I'm not going to protect you forever, Lavinia,' said Bernardo, as he took out the gauntlet and handed it to her. 'If you want to survive on this path, then you've got to learn to protect yourself, starting today.'\nShe was silent for a spell, took the gauntlet, and with no regard for the pain its sharp thorns laced across her skin, she put it on. Then, she walked deeper into the alley depths.\nShe and Bernardo had brushed with death. She knew though the night was deep as ever, Bernardo would not take the same path as her. She had to go it alone into the darkness, a black dyed in sanguine red.\nThe first and only gift Bernardo would ever give her was stained by blood on its very first day.",

          "description": "Night is always hard, especially the ones where she tosses and turns on the bed, waiting for the night to pass. The pale, faded light of dawn is the guest that has yet to arrive, for whom there is nothing to do but wait.\nSuch nights are a familiar friend to Lavinia. What awaits after an exhausting day is yet another exhausting day, filled with pretentious defending counsels, arrogant famiglia and silent judges. The sound of the gavel echoes through the court, yet it is no different from a fairground game, except worse, because at least in a fairground the hammer whacks the mole.\nWhen tormented by such cruel nights, Lavinia pulls out the creased letter from the bottom of her drawer. She remembers finding it under her windscreen wipers; such letters were usually threats and warnings, but this was an exception.\nIt is a short letter, scribbled down hastily, reproaching Lavinia for pronouncing innocent a defendant that the famiglia had sent into the courthouse to take the fall. The letter wrote that Lavinia's 'self-righteous' judgment had done more harm than good, a complaint that she had seen many times: The small attempts of the judges to do the right thing are often futile, any small justice achieved in the courthouse quickly swallowed by the dark night outside.\nYet the writer, after what seemed to be a long struggle with himself, left this line at the end: 'No one cares, but at least there was one person who said I was innocent. Thanks.'\nLavinia has tried to deduce whom the writer of this unusual letter was, which is akin to trying to find a needle in a haystack. There have been so many, people whom she knew were innocent, whom she pronounced innocent, but what of it? As the writer of the letter said: No one cares.\nLavinia never stopped searching. Perhaps she wanted to tell the writer face-to-face, that justice would never be alone and fleeting, as long as she was there, that justice would come at the gavel's drop, as the dawn breaks the night.\nThat is, until she found the coroner's autopsy report on her desk. The cause of death was suicide.\nIf this was the end that Siracusa had for its judges, then what was the point of the justice that she sought?\nA creased letter, a word of thanks. However insignificant it was, even if it could not light her desk like a lamp, perhaps there was someone who felt that she was the only defender of justice, then and there.\nAnd so, she never gave up, even if she fights a lonely battle. If she gives up, there will be no one left to fight it; if she kept silent, there will be no one to speak up.\nThere are two ways to live with the night before the dawn. Allow it to consume oneself, until one does not feel it, or search for what should not be consumed by it, and keep those things safe.\nThe one thing that must not be surrendered is the right to define the light.",

You know that when pale blue light shines in the surface, you are no longer to bother the fins and seabeasts. You know that when the pinnacle of Oberos Lighthouse touches the very top of the Shadow-Moon, we Ægir should return home.\nYou are familiar with the skyscraping surges, and the smallest of sprays. You've learned to converse with them, haven't you? You love to chatter with them, and they are glad to tell you how they are feeling. Do you still remember what they told you? They are but one part of the sea; they are one and the same. You know where the surges will stop and rest, and you know where the tiniest suds will assimilate into the ocean. I have nothing left to tell you now. Hence, this time will be very different; you must prepare yourself, and you must listen to me.\nWe are familiar with the earth and ocean; they have made me and my vessel old, unable to reach farther places. You see? The briny winds dry my cheeks, the air erodes at my bones, the starlight presses down on my shoulders, and if not for you, even lifting this oar would likely be beyond me. But you are different. Your arms are still growing, your bones and flesh are sturdier than mine, your eyes livelier, and your thoughts brighter. You should make it to higher, farther waters. Young child, you must sail far. Child, this sea will be very different. Gone will be the fins you know, gone will be the fearsome seabeasts, and there will be no lighthouse to guide your way, as your destination is in the seas beyond where the stars shine... However, still there will be tides there, still there will be waves, and still there will be countless glimmering specks of ocean foam just like you, Highmore. I trust that, just as before, you will be familiar with these new tides, and familiar with these new waves. They will tell you stories even I haven't heard. You must accompany the twin moons—no, you must go somewhere higher, farther, vaster than the twin moons...\nThe meaning of a voyage is not mine to give, for you will find it yourself. But first you must remember, Highmore, remember what I've told you. A voyage is by no means a retreat, and the reason we leave our home is by no means our disappointment with it. Your voyage is because you are young, because you are sturdy, and because it is for a home as young and hope-filled as you.

          "description": "[Medical Department Log Excerpts]\nToday is examination day for our underage operators. Though the children are bound to misbehave, these chatty brats seem cute and well-behaved compared to the troublemakers who came by for their physicals yesterday. Most Infected children have already started to stabilize, with many of them who had lost their mobility gradually recovering.\nAs for the non-Infected children, excessive weight gain has been observed in some of them, which we've assessed to be reasonable, given the fact that many of them suffered from malnutrition while growing up in harsh environments, and proper nutritious intake at Rhodes Island is likely to result in rapid weight gain.\nHowever, Operator Luo Xiaohei's weight gain is somewhat peculiar. First, his diet falls within a reasonable range. His companions, Ah Gen and Xiaobai, have told us that they have never seen him overeat. Second, he gets plenty of exercise: in addition to his regular operations, he also makes a habit of exercising.\nBased on the above two points, we believe that his weight gain requires further observation to rule out any potential pathological factors that may lead to further problems. We recommend scheduling tests starting next week to identify what these factors might be.\n\n[Excerpts from a Medical Department Operator's Private Logs]\nI'm so tired after a long day of work. My neck and back are aching. I just want to go back to the dorm and crash.\nMy goodness, when will I be free from dealing with all these uncooperative patients? And then there's the brats who won't stop running around...\nWhen I first graduated, I was filled with a sense of duty. Now, I just feel dead inside.\nI ran into that black cat again on my way to Medical this morning. It often shows up there, and a lot of my colleagues have seen it. I suppose it enjoys lying there, basking in the sun. Some of the folks who pass by try to play with it, but it basically ignores everyone unless they offer food. Then, it might show some interest.\nDespite its cold demeanor, everyone seems quite enthusiastic about it, and it's even become the topic of conversation.\nOf course, I'm no exception.\nJust watching it engrossed in eating canned food is enough to briefly make me forget the torment of work.\nI always bring some spare snacks and was planning on bringing some more freeze-dried food tomorrow until I saw this morning that everyone in Medical had brought snacks and cat food. After touching bases, we realized that we'd all been separately feeding it over the last few months.\nNo wonder it has put on so much weight... Maybe I should bring some balls of yarn instead tomorrow.",

          "description": "A fully automatic dual-purpose passenger-freighter carrier device serving the entire landship!\nBefore seeing the design blueprints, none of Engineering's operators would have thought Feist had such a marvelous imagination. No wonder he'd dubbed the plans 'Dreams' and stuck them in the most eye-catching spot of his workbench.\nThe creativity on show in the blueprints was succinct: Preserve the motor core of an FMC, then upgrade it with an all-terrain ambulatory mechanical installation.\n'How many neat automation ideas has this guy got hidden up in that head of his?' Closure was heard to say in appraisal, which served to stir up Engineering even more. Finally, one voice said what everyone was secretly thinking—\n'Let's get this thing made while he's out in the field!'\nPredictably they came to a resounding agreement. They'd all received Feist's help in ways both big and small, or been given one of his timely little presents. Moreover, not one operator there would ever refuse the chance to make someone's dream a reality.\nSeveral workshops joined hands and got down to work, all of Engineering bustling like nobody's business. Driven by wanting to finish it before Feist got back, sticking points were overcome one after another, and progress flew by far smoother than usual. Very soon, the main chassis was fully built, short of just one final step: merging it with a Feist Metal Crab motor system.\nOnce 'MERGE SUCCESSFUL' flashed up on their giant display, ardent applause filled all of Engineering. A brand spanking new automated transport vehicle could enter operation, and it couldn't have happened without the combined hard work of Feist and every single other engineer. Some operators had already begun to imagine how he would react to seeing it: would a lad who'd pulled himself out of the fires of war shed a tear or two? Or would he laugh like mad and give everyone a giant hug?\nThat was when a question came that threw everyone off, its asker stood over by the generator.\n'How does the FMC motor system... actually work?'\nClearly, nobody had given thought to this one little detail preserved from the design, and a moment of silence ensued that felt like forever.\n'Hey, what're you lot all gathered in here for?'\nFeist, who'd come back aboard earlier, gave the crowd a puzzled stare before his eyes fell on the little sheetmetal fellow they surrounded. He blinked, then blinked again, making sure he wasn't just hallucinating.\n'Hold on, you got the Crawler all built? I don't know what to say!'\nAll of Engineering's eyes were on him as he picked up a steel pipe and gave the 'Crawler' a hefty tap on the back. With a loud rumble, the 'Crawler' slowly whirred into motion. That was the instant that reminded everyone just how the FMC operated.\nA few days later, the children aboard Rhodes got the gift Stainless had promised them: a little people-carrying robot that moved when you struck it. There in the shade of a thicket of steel, both his and their dreams had come true at once.\nNow they just needed to find an open space, and everyone could experience the joy of riding a burdenbeast.",

What about this?'\n'The bottle? It's for generating seasoning. Sometimes I add it to chromogen when I'm in the mood.'\n'Don't tell me you drink chromogen—you know what, it's better if I didn't ask.'\n'Oh, I would have loved it if you were interested!'\n'I'm not here to make you happy. I'm here to fix your current mapper.'\n'Boring—'\n'This engraving's really nice. 'Oceanus'? What's that?'\n'Oh, that's the name of the current mapper.'\n'You name your instruments?'\n'Yeah. Same for the Little Handies that I have on the dome. Want to know what they are?'\n'Not really... if this was two centuries ago, the consuls would be debating your behavior, and Consul Oculatus would have had a field day castigating you.'\n'You're exaggerating...'\n'The core component here is beyond repair. I won't ask how you managed to break an instrument with an operating life of five years in the span of just six months... anyway, this has to be recycled. I could disassemble the engraving for you to keep as souvenir, if you want... hey, what are you doing?'\n'Recycling. You said it's beyond repair, so I might as well print a new one.'\n'I thought you would have some attachment to it, the fact that you gave it a name.'\n'I watched a lot of classic movies when I was thinking about adding a holographic playback function to it, so I gave it the name of my favorite movie character at the time. It wasn't because I had any particular attachment to it, just feels livelier that way.'\n'What about the modifications? Aren't you throwing away your creativity?'\n'There will be room to put in new stuff in the new mapper. There would be no room for new ideas if I keep sticking to old ones.'",

          "description": "The night is giving way, and the streetlamps are going out one by one. The only light left hangs in front of a food cart on the side of the street, swaying and flickering, steam drifting up beneath it. The vendor sits by his wok, face hidden behind the steam. He sees a customer in the distance, and stands to raise himself up a little.\n'You haven't been by in forever, Miss.'\n'I'm finally freed up.'\n'You're a busy person. I see you passing through this street every day, but you never sit yourself down here.'\n'One bowl of cart noodles. Oil noodles, curry base, two finballs to top.\n'Got it.'\nThe customer picks herself a spot close to the stovetop, and leisurely seats herself. The cart vendor turns around, stooped over like a fin stranded on land. He ladles out soup to boil the noodles, and chops up the meat, movements fluid and natural.\n'You're still open so late. Looks like business is good.'\n'All by grace of the Rat King... well, used to be. Now it's by yours, Miss. Back when I was apprenticing, no one would dare open at this hour.'\n'Is your medicine still enough?'\n'I've got ways to buy it, and I've never dared stop. I'll get sick if I'm not careful, and that'll be a hassle for you.'\n'No, look after yourself. If you <i>do</i> fall sick, that's far more hassle for you than me.'\n'It's out of you and your father's hands I picked my life back up... The fact you'd sit here to eat noodles means you think enough of me.'\n'My dad's goal has always been for everyone to live good lives—'\n*thunk*—\nWithin the rhythm of the kitchen knife and chopping board lands a heavy, muffled noise, promptly breaking off the subject.\n'Sorry to scare you, Miss... The new smith here does shoddy work. There used to be a smith next door, went by 'Cleavers Leong.' The knives he sharpened cut fast and shone light. Lovely to use.'\n'What happened to him?'\n'Died. Five years ago, he did.'\n'Five years. And people still think about him. He must've been a good man.'\n'Not all that good... You could count on him, but he never held back. Never changed his mind. He made one mistake, that's all it took.'\n'A very serious mistake to make.'\n'You and the Rat King both see right through us. You're smart. Us people below, we're dumb. Sometimes, unwise. You'll be needing to teach us a long time more, Miss.'\n'You'd listen to me, still?'\n'I thank you that you didn't ask how he died, Miss.'\n'You still blame me.'\n'I've said it already. My life comes from out of your hands. No sense in the blame game.'\n'......'\n'Your noodles are done, Miss.'\nThe vendor carefully carries the bowl over to the customer, and doesn't move away after setting it down—he stands and watches her devour the noodles clean, mouthful by mouthful. After she's done, she pulls the cash out from her bag and places it on the counter.\n'No need for change.'\n'The streets are tricky at night. Take your time, Miss.'\n'No need to worry, I can see clearly.'\n'No, you'd better be careful. Us little folk, we need you. We need someone to follow.'\n'It's late. Go on home.'\n'Miss...\n'I don't have the guts to blame you, but I just want to ask one thing...\n'If, right now, you were back then, would you still do the same thing?'\n'I would.\n'I'm here now so that Lungmen never goes through anything like that again.'",

          "description": "The bandit recognizes Qiubai.\nIt was during a summer five or six years ago, when he saw a dying girl lying on the ground in the barrens. The clothes she wore did not appear local, resembling the style of Jiangqi more. 'That's thousands of li away; how did she end up here?' He looked around and found she had nothing with her—no money, no food, no water—yet despite so many people passing by, nobody was willing to help her.\nAny other time, and he would've walked away like all the others. But business had been flourishing, and he was in a good mood. Watching the poor girl before him, he couldn't help but think of his own miserable days, when he wished someone would help him... To save someone is an act of great kindness, and today he was more than glad to be a good person and help this girl.\nHe untied the waterskin from his waist, gave her a few sips, and dragged her into the shade of a boulder. After a while, she opened her eyes. He cracked a satisfied grin, patted her on the shoulder, and left her a few coins. 'Don't cry, girl. Live on.'\n\nQiubai recognizes the bandit.\nIt is winter now. Several corpses lie in the sand, covered by a thin layer of powdery snow.\nRecently, bandits have been quite active outside the village, and the villagers pooled together their money to hire her to take care of them. They said that after a string of Catastrophes, the harvests in the area were disappointing. With poor harvests came poor business. With no money in their purses, bandits began to sprout up like weeds.\nAfter all the whining and complaining, they began to praise Qiubai's skills. The bandits knew they were at the end of their rope, so they took the village's children hostage. Yet she seized the opportunity and struck, slaying them all in a single strike.\nShe does not say a thing.\nShe recognizes the waterskin—or rather, the wine pouch, from which a murky and choking liquor flows—dangling from the waist of a corpse.\nShe thinks back to the man's smile just a few years ago, and to the few sips of water and coins that had kept her going until she could reach the next town. The corpse still holds in his hand a knife—modified from a farming sickle—blackened by layers of blood both new and old. As for her own blade, it had yet to be wiped clean, and still drips red with fresh blood.\nShe sets down her bamboo snow hat in front of the waterskin, and folds into it a plum blossom.",

When the ranch owner takes Helena to see the burdenbeast that evening, this is the first thought that crosses her mind.\nThe burdenbeast stands proud in the corral, its stocky build much larger than any burdenbeast Helena has ever tamed. Fresh scars mar its face and neck, while a fading name is branded onto the side of its belly by hot iron, making it seem particularly extraordinary.\nExtraordinary—an apt word to describe what the burdenbeast has endured. The ranch owner tells Helena that it took the hunters quite some effort to capture it. Tracking the beast alone took five days, as its tracks led them across mountains and valleys, through forests and creeks, almost straight into a full-on Catastrophe. Only after almost wearing out their boots and exhausting all their tranquilizer arrows did they finally manage to bring this legendary burdenbeast back. Many renowned riders have since tried to tame it, all to no avail.\n'What a fine beast,' Helena exclaims.\n'That's right. That's why you're our last hope at taming it,' the ranch owner responds, sounding slightly defeated. 'If even you can't tame it, I'll have no choice but to send it to the slaughterhouse.'\nHelena takes out the bridle and vaults over the fence.\nShe advances slowly and gently towards the burdenbeast until they are less than half a meter apart. In one hand, she holds the bridle; with the other, she caresses its face, fingers tracing the new and old scars. Before anyone can react, she slips the bridle over its neck, tightens the reins, and effortlessly flips onto the beast's back.\nThe ranch owner's gasp is instantly drowned out by the beast's deafening neighs. Helena quickly steadies herself, holding tightly onto the reins no matter how hard the beast kicks and shakes. Enraged, the beast rears up on its hind legs and lets out a furious cry. Helena leans forward, pressing her body entirely against its back. Despite all these years, even as its mane has hardened and its hide has grown rough, the vigor and life force of the wild still course through its veins.\nHelena recalls the evening of her seventeenth birthday. Her father had given her a burdenbeast as a present and had used a hot iron to brand its name onto the side of its belly. 'Anna.'\n'Anna. What a fine beast.' That was what Helena had thought.\nDiscreetly, Helena takes out a dagger from her pocket and, with a gentle nick, cuts the rein. With all its strength, 'Anna' shakes off the bridle and Helena. For a fleeting moment, Helena feels as if their gazes meet, though she cannot be sure. Half a second later, 'Anna' clears the fence with a single leap.\n'Holy! You nearly had it, Helena!' The ranch owner's tone is a mix of excitement and shame.\n'What a fine beast.' That's all Helena says as she gets back up, pats the dirt off herself, and watches as the burdenbeast gallops back into the wild.",

Ahah, there we are, I'll just hide the cake in this drawer for now.'\n'Knock it off, Franka, she's already here—Come in.'\n'Sorry, let me just put my stuff down. Is this the BPRS division?'\n'...Laura Arias?'\n'Yep.'\n'Laura, we'll be conducting an interview for BPRS now. Do you understand?'\n'Franka—'\n'Interview? Don't think anyone told me... Well, whatever, no problem. Go ahead, ma'am.'\n'Okay, listen close, first question—what the hell's this giant thing you brought with you?'\n'Huh, what? That sure is some question... It's the 'Traction Model Long-Distance Transporter Prototype', and it <i>was</i> my capstone project too, but... after packing up for Blacksteel, I made a few improvements to adapt it to the security field. But continuing the R&D takes funds, and applying for funds requires more experimental data, so I'm applying <i>here</i>... It'll be easier to explain if you just give it a try. Either of you ladies interested?'\n'Liskarm, how about you—'\n'I imagine you're dying to try it, aren't you, Franka?'\n'Here, hold this grip, and be careful.'\n'Oftentimes, security work means the enemy's some distance away. After modifications, this piece of gear's now able to drag anything or anyone right up next to you. Just pull the trigger.'\n'Whewww~. That's a lot more stable than any regular hookshot, but this sort of thing is pretty common.'\n'Right, that's the improved <i>basic</i> functionality, and what I'm currently researching lies a little elsewhere. You know, there's times you're in complex terrain and it's hard to get anywhere with your average hookshot, but these mechanical claws can grab onto most anything... Go on, try that out too. Press here and it'll switch modes.'\n'That's pretty handy! Hey, Liskarm, I can grab the you-know-what...'\n'Just use it like you used the other mode. But be careful, it's not fully calibrated yet, so—'\nCrash!\nAnd with that sudden sound, Franka vanishes from where she stood, appearing in an instant on the other side of the room. The cabinet topples over with a colossal thud, and cake and icing splatter all over the floor. Naturally, Franka's face gets the most.\n'Don't fire it at anything unfixed, since it'll drag you there pretty rapidly...'\nLiskarm forces her facial muscles to stay put, and turns to an apologetic-looking Laura.\n'I suppose we don't have a welcoming cake anymore. That concludes the interview. Welcome to BPRS, Laura. Your new life begins here.'",

The young boy seems to be looking for an important treasure, hence his excursion through his big brother's 'secret base.'\n'Look what I found! Liv, you gotta look!'\nThe young girl comes running at the call, and seeing the topsy-turvy state of the room, somewhat angrily pouts.\n'Lut! You... Harley said not to mess with Enis's stuff!'\n'*clatter*! It's the schedule for Enis's part-time job—\n'Don't you wanna know where he went today, and what he's doing now?'\n'......'\nThe boy waves about his brother's schedule, brandishing it like it's a spoil of war. The girl follows with big round eyes, watching fixedly as the sheet flutters through the air. She's totally won over, the errands the grown-ups gave her gone in a puff of smoke.\n'Enis said he'd play kick the can with me!'\n'Enis said he'd braid my hair for me!'\nAnd so, one sprawled on the bed and the other leaning by the wall, the two little rascals vie over it, each wanting the bigger slice of their brother's time.\n'5:30, restock, there is no pepper, if you do not buy it Harley will think the food tastes like nothing again.'\n'9:30, deliver letters, also mail Chuck the trekking sticks he wants, they are just picking up dust at home.'\n1 to 4, Grandpa Tom's sunbathing time, look after store for him. Save ice cream for Liv and Lut, strawberry and chocolate!'\n'At 6...'\n'At 8...'\nThe day was packed, and the to-do list was too. The little ones looked and pondered, and it seemed there was no free time to squeeze in anything else.\n'Oh, with so much to do... will Enis make it back for dinner?'\n'He'll definitely come back for dinner! Instead of going for ice cream, let's help Harley with dinner...'\n'So, no more kick the can?'\n'No more hair braiding!'\nThe little boy pulled out a chessboard from under the bed, and the little girl found the chess pieces in a drawer.\n'After dinner, we can play this!'\n'But Enis has been working all day; he must be really tired... Will he still play with us?'\n'Of course! Enis says...\n'He loves playing with us the most!'",

          "description": "Verdant only manages a single step before a vine thicker than his arm bursts out from the bushes, lunging straight for his waist. The guide by his side tosses a spear, and as if conscious, the vine shrinks back into the tangle.\n'How do they grow so thick?!'\nThe guide scratches his head. 'That's just how they are. You're only here because you were after them, right? How could you not know?'\n'Suppose my boss was lying by omission then,' Verdant sighs. 'He said, there's carnivorous plants snapping about in the depths of the Acahuallan jungle. Keep one indoors, sorts out your Originium slug problem just like that. The big new thing amongst the Victorian gentry, he was betting...'\nThe guide only half-comprehends. All he can really think to ask is 'Do you still want one, then?'\nVerdant clutches his head in his hands. 'Just give me a bit to think about it. He'll be right storming if I don't get a sample, but I want to make sure I save my own <i>life</i> first.'\n'Huh? Save your life? Didn't you tell us you could take on five of our tribe's warriors before we left? Five of us could handle that thing no problem. You think the chief'd let me come here alone with you otherwise?'\n'Well... listen, just think of it as the terms of the job...'\nAt that moment, a vine silently ensnares the guide's ankle, and tugs him away for the undergrowth. Verdant hastily grabs hold of his hand, but the vine's stronger than he expects—so strong, he feels like his shoes are practically plowing the soil under him.\nHe curses his boss in his head, then with his free hand, switches out the vial on his saw, points at the guide's ankle and pulls the trigger. Out bursts a chemical spray, and in no time, the vine around his leg, and the entire thicket, have all withered yellow.\nThe guide springs back up from the ground. 'Brother, thank you! I don't know what to even say—we can pluck that thing and bring it back now!'\n'No, forget it. That was my strongest defoliant I just sprayed—the whole plant's on the way out. Not much point even picking it now.'\n'That's fine, there's always next time! With your wonder drugs, next time we'll get it for sure!'\n'Um, right.'\n'Let me tell you, people who can't back up their words are the kind our tribe hates most, and until just now, I thought you were sketchy as hell, but you did that thing in one go! Now I believe you—you CAN take five at once!'\n'W-Well, yeah, sure I can.'\n'I've got to tell the whole tribe when we get back how you're—you're this!' The guide throws Verdant a thumbs up. 'I bet people'll want to wrestle you, but you'll be fine! Just give 'em a puff of that drug and they'll soften right up, then even a little runt like you can flick 'em over, hahahaha!'\nUnprepared for the guide to start chattering away, Verdant blushes and quietly listens, picturing the proud Tiacauh coming to challenge him one after another. A helpless chill runs down his spine.\nBut compared to heading back and coping with his boss's thunderous temper... maybe this isn't so bad, he suddenly thinks.\nSo tonight he'll drop the pretense, eat and drink merrily, and prepare to get thrashed a couple dozen times.",

Like wafting a breeze to put out a candle, it extinguishes; the Spire's study turns to dusk hues, with only the light of the setting sun coming through the window.\nEvening falls over Zwillingstürme, the sound of music filtering like mist through the Spire's generous walls. It is profound and yet murky, not at all there, yet opaque to the senses. Micha recognizes the piece; Bach's 12th Symphony 'Abendrot', 3rd movement, performed by the Fortsgard Philharmonic Orchestra. From the style, possibly conducted by Ricercar, yet also reminiscent of Graf Lotzmann—is he still allowed into Zwillingstürme these days? Grimmacht had already sent him off to the Black Manor, thirteen months ago. It was Micha himself who delivered the documents...\nA muffled noise ripples past his ear, one he's all too familiar with: his Originium Arts. Silent soundwaves transmit outwards from him, pushing the sound of 'Abendrot' away, until every corner of the study is encompassed. The room is soundproofed, and Micha's mind is proofed from the chaos of any lingering thoughts.\nMicha picks up the pair of castanets, much heavier than any ordinary kind, made of thicker, sturdier wood. On top, the inlaid—well, what used to be inlaid gold thread was gilded with no regard for acoustics, which already ruined the castanets' original timbre, not to mention the oversized gemstones. Thanks to those, they come off as ornate, respectable, no longer capable of the sound they were meant to make. They qualify no longer as an instrument, but an exceptional gift instead, and an exceptional trinket.\nMicha has never really treasured this reward since it was bestowed to him. He doesn't want an instrument permanently stripped of its proper sound—and he knows the one who gave them to him meant it in exactly that way. That's why the castanets scare him, why he detests them, why they prick at him at practically every turn.\nHe won't take them up; he'd rather regard them as a trinket, a child's plaything, to be willfully handled until the gold thread falls off, their formerly sleek black surface riddled with scratches. He once even thought of throwing them away, into the hills, into the wind, back into that curdled-stiff afterglow.\n'You must keep them by your side. Can a toy hurt you? You must keep them by your side, to prove that you and them are different. Not for Lupukarn, but for yourself.' The voice sounds so close to him, but in truth it is further than any other voice could be. Micha knows that that voice is the reason he's kept them. He remembers, gazing at that Spire, how the black shadow it cast would always keep him strong.\nMicha looks out of the window, and all he sees is the golden afterglow.",

Before we begin meditation, let's find the most snug chair to sit in that you can, and get nice and comfortable on it.'\nThat's gotta be this one. I can even stick my tail out between the seat and backrest.\nIt's a bit of a squeeze, but that's fine. The magazine said meditation helps you lose weight, so if I just clamp down where I want my weight to get lost, I bet it'll work even better.\n\n'Keep your body upright, don't lean back. Let your tail hang down naturally, and put your hands on your lap if you want. Relax your shoulders. Keep your airways open. Relax your core.'\nNo, I think I need to sit a little more firm.\nI cut out Gavial's signature from a medical history file last night. I need to be ready, just in case she comes looking for me.\n\n'First, we'll do some deep breathing. In... out. In... out.'\nIn—out—in—out—\n\n'And we'll repeat that, twelve times in total. In... out.'\nThat's so many times—wait, no, I need to stay focused! In, out! In, out!\n\n'Feel... your inner... peace.'\nMy cheeks are all hot. Does this count as peace? I guess so.\n\n'Close your eyes. Let all your pressure fall away. And then, inside your mind, picture a beautiful wish.'\nBeautiful wish? I want to be able to help Gavial out!\nIf Gavial wants to be a doctor, then I'll sort out everything else for her! I'll lead the tribe, I'll be a lord ameer, I'll even fight the fights I don't want to!\n\n'And then, hold that beautiful feeling inside your mind.'\nAnd then Gavial will praise me for doing good, and she'll say, Tomimi, you're the one I can count on most, you're always helping me out with stuff—\n\n'Now before your eyes, a beautiful scene is going to appear.'\nGavial... in front of me... telling me I'm the most reliable ever?!\nWaaaaaahhhh!\n\n'Now focus on your breathing...'\n'Yo, Tomimi. There you are.'\n'Ga-Ga-Ga-Ga-Gavial! Have I been helping you out?'\n\n'Don't try to control your breathing. Concentrate on the feelings that surround it...'\n'Huh? A bunch, I guess.'\n'Really?!'\n\n'Don't try to follow any thoughts...'\n'I mean, not the time with the rocket launcher. But down in Zeruertza, and when we headed back to Acahualla, right? You were right there helping me—hey, hold on, quit swishing your tail. You're gonna wreck that chair—'\nCrash.\n\n'Imagine yourself inhaling pure energy, exhaling your muddied, negative emotions...'\n'Gavial gave me that tail clamp just yesterdayyyyy!'",

By the soft glow of the campfire's dying embers, Delphine writes the first sentence in her diary entry, then halts, suddenly realizing how it's been almost a year since the close of that great Londinium war. When she first went over Victoria's borderlands, then a knight-errant, she discovered iniquity in spades that had scant weighed on her before, so as time passed, her sword became a habit, dispensing the justice she felt right.\nThus, when she learns of a still nearby band of Sarkaz vagrants disquieting the locals and looting wherever they please, she finds a destination. 'Perhaps just more wretches who found the war had ended before they even made it to Londinium.'\n'Help me...'\nEyes following the voice, she looks back. A young Feline girl pokes her head out from the shadows.\nShaking, the girl points to the far black horizon, whereupon Delphine finally catches sight of the blade-wielding figures, four in total. They approach.\n'It's devils, the lot of them. Could you get me home?' the girl asks.\nFrom its hefty scabbard, Delphine draws what was once her mother's saber, through which courses Originium Arts. Their glow casts light on the girl's frightened face, shallow scars and black crystals thrown into sharp relief.\nThe distant figures pause, then not a moment later turn to leave, and disappear back into the dark of the horizon.\n'You want me to take you home?'\nBriefly, the girl hesitates. Without the courage to meet Delphine's fierce gaze, she merely hangs her head and nods.\nYet once back at the camp, they are refused at the gate. The camp's leader is wary, on guard against Delphine who follows the girl closely.\nAnd Delphine needs but a glance to see how the camp's Feline Infected gather, whips stowed at the ready, trying to hide the Sarkaz children quaking in terror.\nDelphine's fury ignites. 'You make an innocent child pretend she's hunted. You trick countless people to this camp, only to hurt them.'\n'Be on your way.' Delphine lets the girl go, then singles out the leader. 'You, with me. There will be a price to pay for the innocents you've hurt.'\n'I'm only helping my people out.'\nDelphine shakes her head. 'That's no excuse. Have you given any thought to how these children will be when they grow up?'\nShe takes the leader far away, far enough that no eye in the camp could reach them.\n'I'll contact Rhodes Island to assist them. Now, en garde.'\nOn her 231st day on field assignment, Delphine bears a scabbard with one scar more, and sallies forth for a direction that leaves Victoria only further behind.",

This old soldier, with but one leg to his name, no longer must weather the winter's bite in agony. But I must admit, I was taken aback to learn it hails from the pharmaceutical venture recently founded by Freya's brother. Why, that poor lad was still dwelling in squalor when I was on assignment in Kjerag! It seems he's amassed quite a fortune from peddling his medicines to the Victorians, hasn't he? A new company and all its trappings!\nHowever, upon scrutinizing the spray's formula, I couldn't help but notice its striking resemblance to the concoction I once used for mending fractures on burdenbeasts. Just a few additional herbs from Kjerag, and it performs like no other remedy I've encountered. Truly, you must be under Kjeragandr's divine protection.\nEverything good with you and Freya? How is the burdenbeast rental business going? You mentioned plans to build an abode by the Lake Silberneherze—why have I not yet seen any photographs of this endeavor? I eagerly await the day I can pay a visit to you both. And some good news: I spoke with the Chief of the Silverash Family about you and Freya, and I am pleased to report he did not oppose your union. Live your lives well, my friend.\nSpeaking of which, I find it quite difficult to fathom the intricacies of a Kjerag wedding. Forgive my curiosity, but do you exchange your vows by the serene waters of Lake Silberneherze or in Hoff Angrsaal? Before the revered statue of Kjeragandr? Must the parents of the betrothed be present as well? Regardless, I wish you a joyous marriage. And should any of your burdenbeasts suffer a broken leg once more, simply let me know.\nAfter all, when people's fortune in war is as grim as mine, we have no other choice but to help each other 'replant legs', and carry on. I may be a noble, but a fancy hat does not change the nature of this hapless creature underneath. I may possess the knowledge to mend the limbs of burdenbeasts, yet I remain at a loss when it comes to mending my own, or those of others. Allow this old cripple to extend his pity to his 'own kind'—Might you, through your pharmaceutical connections, explore whether there are other Victorian soldiers in need of their legs 'replanted'?\nI earnestly hope that, in the near future, everyone may walk on strong, healthy legs.\nHarold",

After making exceedingly short work of her operator exam, the remaining downtime was spent with her enlightening our HR operators as to their significance.\n- Knight-Champion of Kazimierz Medal\nBlack medal of crossed swordbreakers, lying unassumingly in center of case. Design makes it immediately clear that Kazimierz tailored this champion's medal to her. She reigned for three straight years and so was given three, but only the first was personally awarded to her by the Grand Knight after usurping the defender. Which is why she didn't throw it away, and why it's the one artifact of Kazimierz she still carries with her.\n'Commemorative enough, barely.'\n- 'Thanks'\nInverted triangle inscribed with Kjerag's holy Mount Karlan. Not issued by any official organization, rather forged for her by clan head Ratatos at the request of a household under Browntail rule. Degenbrecher had rescued said household's members from an avalanche.\n'This first one was almost ten years ago now. I know they meant it nicely, and I don't mind how it looks. But the news spread, and now I get one of these medals from the Tri-Clans any time I do something similar. The cupboard at home is full of them.'\n- 'The Silverashes' Sword and Shield'\nSecond medal from the left, sword and shield motif. All of Karlan Trade knows that those wearing this medal are free to act unimpeded wherever Karlan Trade is concerned. Initially a pass designed expressly for her by Enciodes, but as soon became apparent, nobody simply overlooks the presence of Degenbrecher. Its worth these days is instead in gently reminding others that she is affiliated with Karlan Trade.\n'One day, I forgot to wear this one. Enciodes went that entire day quieter than usual, then in the end asked if I had any complaints with the company.'\n- 'Kjeragandr's Soldier'\nThird medal, honorary decoration issued by the Vine-Bear Court, was worn by Enya herself when she formally became the Saintess.\n'This was the biggest protest the Saintess could make back then. I don't think much in particular about Kjeragandr—at most, I think I'd like to take Her on.'\n- '10 Years'\nTo mark ten years of acquaintance, Enciodes rustled up a little gift for her, effectively commemorating her Karlan Trade decennial at the same time. It may not have been founded when they first met, but the blueprints were already laid out in his heart.\n'I didn't even recall what it was commemorating when he gave me this. A token of thanks, I suppose, but I'm sure he just wanted to let me know that he still remembered the big words he said back when it all began. Speaking of Kjerag... if you're ever there as a tourist and want to find somewhere quiet, you can ask me.'",

          "description": "Human Resources Record File RF-099-47\nDay One\nOperator Ray has been reported missing this morning without submitting any official application to leave the ship. Human Resources is currently collaborating with Field Operations to investigate.\nDay Two\nWhile the Field Operations team conducts searches, we have also reviewed Ray's recent activities. On the night before her disappearance, she attended a private dance, which we consider to be abnormal behavior. We interviewed Alanna, Ray's friend and an intern at the Workshop, for more details. Below is an excerpt from our interview:\n'To think a weirdo like her went to a dance! I would never have believed it was her, but her cookie-shaped bangs were too iconic.'\n'What did she do at the dance?'\n'Umm... She just sat in a corner. Now that's more like something she'd do.'\n'Did she get into contact with anyone during the dance?'\n'Well, there was this old lady with a cane who sat in the corner with her.'\n'Did they interact in any way?'\n'That's the strange part! Neither of them spoke at all. It was as if they weren't at a dance, but sitting in a sauna house!'\nDay Three\nAccording to our investigation, the elderly woman whom Ray interacted with is a retired Operator from the Logistics Department currently on Rhodes Island for Oripathy treatment. She provided the following explanation for her attendance at the dance:\nShe used to be a dance teacher in her youth but had to end her career prematurely due to Oripathy. Now, severe crystallization of her left leg requires her to use a cane for walking.\nStatement from Retired Operator: 'All I wanted was to see young people dance.'\nDay Four\nAfter another futile day of searching, the search party witnessed two 'blue ghosts' as they were about to return. The Field Operators quickly assumed battle formations but broke formation after carefully probing said 'ghosts' with Arts: One of them was Ray.\nNext to Ray was a wasteland burdenbeast, its thick skin folds glistening with a blue hue as it heaved and twisted its massive body, as if dancing. Ray, also covered in a blue light, remained motionless. However, she was smiling like a child—a rare sight.\n[Supplementary Information]\nRay later learned that the blue light came from the dust pheromone of the Fluorescent Originium Slug, which causes intolerable irritation upon contact with the skin. This explained why the burdenbeast appeared to be dancing; in reality, it was writhing in itchiness. As for why Ray could remain unaffected by the itch... her 'excellent' rating in physical resilience is well-deserved. Below is an excerpt from our interview with her:\n'So, why did you suddenly leave the ship?'\n'I wanted to find the big burdenbeasts on the Colombian wasteland and make them dance to the moon again.'\n'Err... Did this have anything to do with the dance you attended? Was it because of the old lady who sat next to you?'\n'Yes. Her eyes showed me that she wanted to dance. So I suddenly felt that it was time to let the burdenbeasts dance again.'\n'... Huh?'\n'Yup.'\n'Well, umm, did you ever meet that old lady again? Maybe you'd like to tell her about your experience?'\n'No... but you're right, that'd be nice. If it's not too much trouble, could you tell her for me?'",

          "description": "'He Sheng—'\nHe Sheng leaps from the earthen slope, turning his head wildly. He rises in a hurry and his thread spool falls into the water, leaving his paper kite cut in the shape of a fowlbeast's tail to become nothing but a tiny dot in the pale blue sky in the blink of an eye, disappearing before his eyes as it follows the river's current.\nHe Sheng himself was brought to Dahuang by this very river. Were it not for the strong wind that guided him to the shore's embrace, were it not for the sharp, attentive eyes of the farmer hauling sandbags, a babe of not even two years would surely have met with disaster. The Tianshis and the farmers had discussed arrangements for him throughout the night, sent for instructions from the Ministry of Revenue, and even dispatched a Messenger to head directly upstream. However, that year the north had suffered floods after a great drought, while the south was buffeted by a vicious Catastrophe, and so the search for his parents had borne no fruit.\nSince then, he was known as He Sheng, and he was considered born in Dahuang.\nHe grew up atop the crop ridges. He grew up by the water pumps. He grew up on top of the mobile greenhouse frames. He grew up in the Tianshi dormitories and the farmers' courtyards. He grew up in the service channels between the artificial canals. He remembered Tianshi Shu giving palm readings to the children his age, then dabbing a drop of wine onto their foreheads. He remembered sitting atop the backs of stockbeasts alongside Grain Buds, surveying the container ships reminiscent of small mountains slowly entering the waterways, leaving for distant Baizao, Shangshu, or perhaps Danyan to the north. He also remembered one time that an experimental field of high-sugar crops spontaneously combusted, and Dahuang was filled with the inescapable sickly-sweet scent of boiling syrup for a month.\nHe Sheng rubs his eyes and spots the old farmers he's known since childhood rushing towards him. 'You've passed your exams,' they shout along with his name, joy plastered across their faces. 'You've passed your exams, and Tianshi Shu said she'd take you on as an apprentice!' Behind them, a small stockbeast languidly chews on the fresh grass, a brand-new metal ruler tied to its back alongside a silver kite. A strong wind pushes him towards the crowd, while little bells jingled and jangled amidst the hubbub that had swallowed up heaven and earth.\nHe jumps down from the slope, running beside the Yiwei plate's canal, pulling a silver wind behind him.",

          "description": "Zhan Yan has realized that he is on the brink of falling and turning into mincemeat.\nHe had been arguing with his fellow Shanhaizhong fugitives a moment ago, when in the blink of an eye, they faded away one by one into the forest's faint shadows. All he could remember was that a spear had embedded itself into a tree trunk, and then he was bound by a rope that had suddenly dropped out of the sky, after which he found himself suspended above a riverside cliff.\n'Zhan Yan, male, Feline, from the eastern side of Jiangqi.'\nUpon hearing these words, the trussed-up villain stares at the young man who said them. All he sees is a Phidia youth clad in black, carrying a long box and walking alone atop the precipice.\n'You have collaborated with the Shanhaizhong, gathering in the wilderness as part of your sinister schemes... As chief among them, are you aware of which of Yan's laws you have broken?'\n'Pah! You think a limp-wristed bureaucrat like you with hardly a hair on his chest can scare me? I'll kill you, right here, right now!'\nThe river mist scatters, and the moonlight shines upon the 'bureaucrat's' iron mask.\n'Son of a-! You-You're a Sui Regulator Candleholder!' Zhan Yan's entire body breaks out into a cold sweat.\n'Since you are aware of the Sui Regulators, then you must also be aware that...' The youth takes a single step forward. 'While colluding with the Shanhaizhong, you have committed no small number of grisly and violent murders. A Candleholder has the authority to act as a substitute for a formal trial under the Three Organs of Justice, and may render their judgement on the spot.'\nThe wind blows—\nZhan Yan too was no ordinary man, and grits his teeth in defiance, waiting for the opportune moment when the Candleholder approached to hoist his body up, throwing out a fierce and mighty 'Daogua Jinzhong' kick! His dagger-like toe claw lets out a howling wind, coming dangerously close to the youth's throat while slicing apart the rope holding him aloft. The imposing villain shrugs off his tattered bonds, leaping down into a passing fishing boat below the cliff and grabbing the steersman by the arm.\n'Get this boat moving! Faster, dammit!' The boat's engine sputters to life, picking up speed as it leaves the riverbank. Thanks to his daring escape from a summary execution by the Sui Regulator, Zhan Yan can't help but proudly look back at the clifftop.\nWith the aid of the boat's aft lanterns, he clearly sees the black-clad youth take a deep breath before using the momentum of kicking off from the cliff edge to fly midair for twenty-odd zhang in a flash. The waves of the river are dotted with a multitude of white flowers, and he looks to all the world like an onyx leaf blown by a great gale, quietly landing aboard the boat.\nThe box opens, and the youth lightly clasps his scabbard.\n'This is Sui Regulator business. You will be compensated as per the law once I am done here.'\n'You—'\nZhan Yan begins to open his mouth, but is quickly shut up by the lanterns on either side of the boat being neatly sliced off by the youth's sword. The straight and sharp longsword stirs up fragments of glass in the dark, causing Zhan Yan's heart, still leaping wildly from his daring escape, to calm into icy terror. The cutting edge has not yet descended. Instead, like a lance, the youth kicks past the steersman's shoulder, his foot implanting itself into the villain's throat. Zhan Yan feels all the strength leave his body and he slams backwards onto the boat's deck, a warm river of fear between his thighs. Just before losing consciousness, he finally clearly sees the deep green eyes behind the iron mask, dark as the new moon, alongside the golden words inscribed on the inside of the box, only seen when fetching the sword—\n'Candle Bright, Stay Shining. You Night, Be Fleeting.'",

          "description": "May 10th\nIt feels like I'm going in circles. These so-called 'social activities' keep dragging me back to Dahuang. Not only does the weather not suit me, I can barely understand their accent, and I heard that their pickled vegetables are super super salty! I don't know how I'm going to make it an entire year.\nAs I expected, nothing's gone right since I arrived. I thought I could at least talk to people, but I keep tripping over my own tongue. Not only can nobody understand a word I say, but the stockbeasts keep running away from me!\n\nMay 21st\nI've run into a strange young girl, standing tiptoe atop the backs of the stockbeasts. She jumped around on top of them, and at first glance you'd think she was a fowlbeast that had fallen into the herd. There I was, one leg sunk deep in the mud while my other foot is barely covered, trudging through the muck, when she started laughing at me.\n'Sillyhead!', she said.\nMe...?\n'Take off your shoes!'\nEh?\n'I'll teach you how to walk on top of the stockbeasts so you don't have to go through the mud.'\nI got thrown off the stockbeasts' backs eight times that day, and I'm sure I ate more mud than rice by dinner time. She thumped me across my back, her plumage flapping about as she laughed. Though my luck may be bad, looking at her smiling face makes me feel that there's nothing that can hold me down for long.\n\nJuly 8th\nThat girl was crouching down by the stockbeast pen this time, swaying her head as she played her flute to the herd.\n'Hey, Claypot! Come, quick!'\nWho...?\n'You're new here, right Claypot? I forgot to tell you last time, but my name's Grain Buds!'\nOh, was she talking to me?\n'Do you want to learn how to talk to stockbeasts? I'd say I'm better at it than anyone in all of Yan!'\nShe held my face in one hand, while holding a stockbeast's in the other, and told us to look into each other's eyes. That day might be the first time I realized a stockbeast's bright, intelligent eyes possess the same basic range of emotions as any man. Since then, the stockbeasts really did stop running away from the sound of my voice. I never expected someone like me—who's always getting chased and nipped by tuskbeasts—to suddenly have a group of animal friends.\n\nOctober 4th\nI was out searching for Grain Buds when I ran into her along with another youth who appeared to be a schoolboy. They were playing some odd game where they threw small pieces of bone.\n'Claypot! Come play with us!'\nOh, alright...\n'He's 'Big Buffalo', have you two not met before?'\nI'm afraid not...\n'These were left over from Shu's stew! I don't really know all the rules myself, so you'll have to explain, Big Buffalo!'\nI had no idea that you could turn stockbeast leg bones into toys. A shame I was so clumsy, though. I couldn't catch the bones for quite a long while, and kept accidentally flinging them at their heads instead. Big Buffalo was a nice guy. Didn't talk much, just like me. However, every time he went off to work, he wanted to bring me along. Sometimes Grain Buds would lie down on a stockbeast's back, or hang from a tree. Sometimes she would help us out with work, and other times she would drag us off to play. Out here in the boundless fields, it almost felt like we were a family.\n\nMay 20th\nAs I was leaving Dahuang by car, a group of stockbeasts wandering the fields walked past. Looking at their chubby figures fade into the distance behind us, I suddenly began to feel uneasy, just like I did a year ago when I left home by myself to come to Dahuang. Setting aside not being able to see Dahuang's fields and stockbeasts any longer, would I be able to find friends as good as Grain Buds and Big Buffalo at school? I don't know how I'm going to make it through the next two school years.",

You have our boundless thanks for coming all this way!'\n'Elżbieta Bosak, operator codename Ela.'\n'Hah! There was an old local saying before Sargon came: 'Respect the Minoan, even should they come bearing gifts.' You may be of Kazimierz, but that striking majesty—in you is the stuff of Minos!'\n'I'm not sure that saying means what you think... Anyway, I'd like to ask you something, seeing as you're the leader around here.'\n'Very well! As temple priest, I promise you that any answers I hold are yours!'\n'I'm told this nation only recently gained independence?'\n'Yes and no. Minos and Hymnoi were born to walk together, two peas in a pod, their histories as one; that said, speaking solely of when we drove out the Sargonians... Hah! The great River Delphi has seen neither pike nor polearm in decades! While West Vouivre still battles with Sargon...'\n'And since your independence, you've been working on a large-scale cultural revival and art restoration?'\n'...Oh, so that's what you meant—I should be clear, placid as Myrinia is, it is by no means in dire straits. All the daily medicines and inhibitor doses used by the villagers are, as you can see, a duty easily borne by my temple. Let alone the claim that the sculptures outside—dating from the ancient city-states—are left unrepaired for a lack of funds!'\n'Then why are you leaving your marble statues out there in pieces?'\n'The course and prayers of our ceremonial rites, the neighbors and their village, all I know by heart; the bygone affairs of the three capitals, and the wider state of the greater land, I am likewise well-informed.\n'Yet how can I possibly know the who, the what, and the why of those sculptures' makers and molders? Whither did strike their chisel, and whence did fall their hammer?\n'I know not, the villagers know not, and nor do the masters of crafts or the sophists of the scholastic—how then, can I repair them? Hence, they have never been repaired.'\n'Why not use your imagination?'\n'Nay, nay! The chroniclers shall be anonymous, as shall the heroes! The man in the wine jar with not a coming nor a going has biographers still to testify of him to this very day.\n'Think about it, now. Supposing today I went to the wilds beyond the village and sought a statue, unknown and unnamed. Presumably by my Forte's strength, I could on my own have it standing anew.\n'Yet I could also go out today and plant a stake in the ground, and what difference would that make?'\n'...When the artist is known by no one, the art transcends society.'\n'If you were to put it in baffling terms, then more or less, yes!'\n'But it's not like you want art that transcends society.'\n'...If you were to put it in baffling terms, then more or less, yes!'\n'Then how about art that <i>records</i> society?'\nAnother day...\nThe fowls commence their recital of the verse of daybreak, Minos's golden sun dawns His golden gift upon the village of Myrinia as He always has, and the villagers are startled to find that the temple's solemn walls do not, as was their custom and theirs alone, return that gift with the purest white dazzling gleam.\n'Priest, what are these garish drawings?'\n'The artist claims them to be our very selves—this is a kind of foreign wall art by the name of 'graffiti'!'",

Internal team comms, confidential.\n'Uh, X days since the transfer incident—I'll fill that in once I get back to base—and 41 days since beginning experiments in Sargon.\n'While sun was up, retrieved all cameras we deployed on the first day. Currently loading obtained images into terminals. Terminals here can only do wired connections to the server, and the server in my car isn't powerful enough to handle my processing needs, so any specific analysis needs to wait until I get back to base.\n'I brought along my eyes and brain too, so while it's loading I've been going through these photos manually since sunup. That way I can at least get some preliminary hypotheses going, and can to some extent inspect and verify the results we've previously observed elsewhere.\n'The Columbians—I mean, Terran Columbians—recently launched an experimental device that's likely a high-energy particle beam. Opened a hole in the sky. 'The sky is fake' will probably end up as common sense and popular opinion.\n'Meanwhile, our own experiment seems likely to help infer the coherence and uniformity of this false sky.\n'Just examining the photos with the naked eye, the stars demonstrate clear discontinuities between different times and regions. Far worse than what the literature describes. Conclusion waiting on main server analysis, but I estimate it won't be too far from my first instinct.\n'This implies the sky <i>has no coherence whatsoever,</i> and is essentially more of a regional projection originating from outside. I have a few other conjectures as well.\n'That said, I still have confidence in the terrestrial planet hypothesis—ordinary optical surveys support this. While most locals may not be able to give a full justification, universally they have an awareness—they've likely never seen the sea their whole lives, but they know the land beneath them is actually round.\n'The people here understand wireless technology, but their signals seem unable to reach this planet's ionosphere. Their alternative is a sort of linked relay: ultra-high bandwidth, energy cost practically negligible. But it appears that because of this, they've never tried to use medium-wave signals for long-range wireless communication. I can't tell just from the literature whether the issue is with the D or F layer—of course, this assumes Terra has atmospheric and sunlight conditions comparable to Earth. I personally think this is extremely likely.\n'Their technology, the way it shifts, and the root of its development may seem completely unlike ours, but counterintuitively there are similarities too.\n'......\n'Actually, I replicated Karl Jansky's experiment here. Nobody seems to have thought of it, so it fell to me to do it for them. Couldn't help myself, sorry.\n'These local Terrans don't know where we merry few came from, but their curiosity in the world outside this planetarium is growing as I speak.\n'And I want to help them. I want to be one of the explorers.\n'I've always wanted to, no matter where.\n'......\n'Alright, let's see what signals the antenna's picking up...\n'Huh?\n'This intensity, this... period...\n'What is this?'",

Beside her lies a light and dirtied mattress, upon which a Lupo man about her age writhes, limbs as if tied in knots. But his face is peaceful enough, and his sweat has more or less subsided—effects of the medicine.\n'Don't worry, I promise I won't hold you up. I may even be able to help you further.'\nA tan-skinned middle-aged man continues to try and persuade him. He has no obvious racial characteristics, rendering him slightly mysterious.\n'Look, we get disasters on this route all the time. That's why it's all us old folks running it. Why should you have to risk it?'\n'There's a Catastrophe Messenger in town; I have a map he drew. Your destination should be within comms range of that city. If this is about safety, then all the more reason I should come with you.'\n'We... but we only have enough water and rations for ourselves. We don't mean to be stingy, but when supplies are this scarce we can't afford another mouth...'\n'I have my own provisions. We just need to follow the route on the map, and you won't run out of food or water. Add in my supplies, and we'll have even more flexibility.'\n'This old wagon of ours only sits two at the front. We couldn't possibly trouble you.'\n'I can sit with the cargo, I've no problem with that.'\n'Well—we'll unload as soon as we get there and there's nothing for us to haul back. If we leave first, you won't have a ride back to Siracusa for quite a while.'\n'Doesn't matter, I'll rendezvous with my friends in the city... I just insist on finding my way there alone, that's all. I know you mean well, madam, but you don't need to worry for me. I'm just as concerned for the two of you. Your health, I mean.'\n'......\n'*sigh*\n'I know what you're going for. We <i>do</i> see people like you now and then. But that city's people want for everything, and just the little we send them hardly even makes a difference sometimes. You'll see as much if you go; with bad luck, you'll die there yourself... In the end, whether it's the city folk or us outside, we're all good people living tough lives.\n'We're old. We're used to it. But why should you have to?'\nGustave Kateb lifts his head and gazes in the direction he's bound for. He cannot see anything resembling a road, and though he hears that it's a gargantuan structure that spits earth, smoke, and dust and is assembled from an array of nomadic plates, no city has yet entered his vision. Only the haze of sand and ash on the horizon, reflected in eyes of the same shade.\n'You're not wrong. I still know far too little about this place, and my past experience won't always apply. Even if I'm prepared physically, I have no basis to claim I'm ready mentally.\n'But time is short, and there's too much to do. Overthinking this gets me nowhere. So stop trying to talk me out of it and let's go.'\nThe city's name is Kazdel. To him, the place is completely unfamiliar. Even its name cannot be found in the land of his birth.\nBut that does not matter. He is a doctor. Whether at home or afar, he is always pressed to go to wherever needs him most.",

With the machine kicked into auto anyway, it's not like it needs nannying.\nSeeming to recognize as much, the man finally turns his head. His eyes are hidden behind a black visor, barely discernible. He remains silent, and simply extends two fingers on his right hand and gives his own helmet a few taps.\n'Go on and say somethin', will ya? Saaaaay—woooords—'\nThroughout this temporary worksite echoes the rumble of Originium electronics, more often than not a soundboard to rival a nomadic plate's engine layer. But the voicebox of a Rim Billy worker, like the workers themselves, is filled with a power that cuts through just about everything.\nThe man appears a little confused. He feels around behind him, then unexpectedly pulls out a mirror. He takes a glance at his own reflection, then raps on his helmet again in the same manner as before.\nThe worker doesn't get to respond before he sees, out of nowhere on the man's visor, a smiley face positioned right between where his eyes would be. There's a line of Victorian text below too, split by his nose into halves. The left side reads 'I'M SHY,' and the right, 'AND QUIET.'\nThe worker tries as hard as he can to keep a straight face. His lower lip twitches side to side, his teeth grind over each other, and he doesn't leak a single word.\nBut soon, he can't hold in anymore, snorts, and begins to laugh.\n'Probe has reached scheduled depth. Drill decelerating. Prepare to turn off and take samples.'\nThat's an announcement from Control Center 2. It sits 80m straight above them, and 50m above that are the natural caves of Camp 2 and tracks to the auxiliary shafts. Another 600m up is the surface, and outside from there are the Tallgann Mountains for miles and miles forever.\nThe drill mentioned in the announcement is a fair way deeper into the earth than they are.\n'—Hold on, Number 2 is too deep. Abnormal tremors in 2's shaft walls. Calling emergency stop!' The second announcement comes hot on the heels of the first, as if some kind of prank.\nSomething unwelcome has been welcomed. The worker throws himself onto the control panel, pounding a fist on the largest, roundest red button of them all. It's the one to emergency-dump the drill and inject extra polymer prep into the shaft walls.\nBut the injector doesn't respond, and the Originium electronics continue to roar.\nA ginormous thud echoes through the worksite, seemingly not from deeper depths, but from times long, long ago.\nOne thud becomes two, then three, then a string of them. The two watch as even the wall outside them finally begins to experience its own fierce tremors.\nNumber 2 has drilled too deep and awakened something, and that something is heading for the sunlight.\n'Detonating all Cluster Charges!' The worker's never heard this voice before, but in an instant discerns that it has to be the man's shout.\nPerhaps because of this shout, or perhaps because of what it triggers elsewhere...\nThe tremors cease. Silence seems to reign again for a while, until there comes another announcement urging evacuation.\n'Your tender said 'use of Originium explosives forbidden', so here I am.'\nThis may be the second time the man's opened his mouth today, and his voice is far quieter than a moment ago.\n'There's issues with your emergency injector system. Once we're up top, come with me to tell them, and then I'll take a look.'\n'Er. Right. You got it.'\nAfter experiencing an accident whose true severity will only be known later, a conversation finally ensues.\n'...What's with that light-up stuff in your visor though, eh? That's one hell of a lark, buddy.'",

How did I get here, though?\nWait, is someone there?! Show yourself! Don't move!\n...A Zalak? Ha, guess I was rescued by some little girl.\nShe calls herself a battlefield cleaner. Found me on my last legs and dragged me back here.\nWhen she saw me wake up, she gave me my stuff back. Weapon, medkit, even my dog tag.\nBefore I could even thank her, she'd already gone to the next guy.\nLorenzo? Now that I get a good look, that poor torched bastard is actually Lorenzo.\nHey, let go of him, Zalak! He's one of us! Get away from him!\nHe's still alive, goddammit! Can't you see him breathing? He's still trying to survive! I'll save him!\nDammit, Lorenzo, why's your body so cold? He's still bleeding—\n......\nLorenzo's dead.\nHis wounds were too much, I... I couldn't save him.\nThat Zalak girl brought back another wounded soldier. An enemy.\nDammit... They're the ones who killed Lorenzo. I wanna kill the bastard, but it's like that girl is stubbornly blocking me.\nShe told me I could save this one. She wanted me to save him.\nHa, this is beastshit. I couldn't save Lorenzo, but I can save an enemy...\nThe girl's heading out again. She's put wheels on her shield; says she can carry more people that way.\nI hear people snorting and laughing in disdain, and others groaning in pain.\nI hear explosions above me, and feel dust falling into my eyes. It stings.\nRight... What was even the point of this battle, where people die every day?\n......\nTwenty-three. There are now twenty-three people in this hole in the ground, all brought back by that girl.\nShe's far stronger than she looks, considering she could drag all these people back.\nI feel numb. I inject meds into the injured, dress their wounds, and wait for their breathing to steady and their faces to relax.\nI just... don't want to see any more pain and suffering.\nI don't know when it started, but I feel hot all over. I hear the feeble calls of one of the wounded, and I lean over to put my ear up against their mouth—\nI'm surprised to hear a trembling 'thank you.'\nI wanted to check his dog tag, but all of a sudden, I can't see anything through the tears.\nI know that I didn't need to know his identity. I just needed to know that someone survived.\nThat's right. Thanks to her, I lived, and they lived too.\nWe lived. Is there anything more meaningful than that?",

The blade slides along its tracks out into the fierce sunlight, pinpricks of light dripping down its edge until coming together like molten iron silently filling a mold.\nIn the heat, there is only quiet.\nThis quiet is broken by the hissing of carrion fowlbeasts. Under the scorching sun, an elderly Sarkaz lifts his head, and sees mist careening down the sides of the canyon towards him. The burdenbeast disappears, as does the canyon. The faintest shadow crosses his eyes, another layer of gray atop the ones from gazing at the forge year round.\nThe blade leaves his chest soon after. His skewered torso fills with blood, leaving him to drown on dry land. He remembers that this slow death was but one of many cruel punishments used in Kazdel. At first, he thinks he will spend his final moments lying flat on the hot sands, his puzzled burdenbeast his only deathbed companion. However,  the deathmonger hasn't left yet. She kneels down on one knee, supporting his back.\n'Oh... it's you.'\nThe wrinkles on his face gradually smoothen. He still remembers those eyes. Back then, he had looked up from the forge to see a girl by the general's side. She was young, but had a warrior's eyes, and hands that could tear apart a storm. Then the general told him to make her a sword.\n'Can I see it one last time?' She observes the old man's longing gaze. 'I... didn't see it clearly just now.'\nThe deathmonger looks towards her wrist. She remembers those willing to die for their cause. The armories of the Military Commission offered excellent equipment, but... She places her hand on the old man's chest. The death-defying fighters were prepared. Kazdel's finest smith had personally forged their regicidal blades.\nHer finger curls, lightly touching the base of her palm. The blade slides along its tracks out into the fierce sunlight, pinpricks of light dripping up its edge until coming together. The old man strokes these points of light. He knows their true identity. Every parry, every strike, leaves a scar upon its edge. Some of the scars are stained with his blood.\n'As I forged it... the fires told me that one day, it would take my life. But... it was a commission from the general.' The old man raises his torso, struggling to breathe as he lifts his head to look into his deathmonger's eyes.\n'How about you? Shadow beneath the sun. Who commissioned you... to settle this account?'\nThe deathmonger does not answer. She covers his eyes with her palm, allowing her sleeve-blade to cut across his throat. The carrion fowlbeasts whirl down from above the canyon, crowding into the shadows of the cliff and rubbing their beaks against one another's feathers.",

          "description": "Nightfall, the time Aefanyl has been patiently waiting for has come. He gently pulls aside the curtains of black silk—woven by his mother and the elders—around his small bed. He takes a while to get dressed, then quietly leaves the bedroom. He silently walks through the long stone corridor, across the open courtyard and road, and past the flickering candles and lights that stave off the darkness. On his way to the river, the oblique moonlight and faint firelight behind him cast a spattering of vague shadows around his feet. Everything around him becomes a part of the child's night adventure.\nDuring the day, when the sun's not hidden behind clouds, the Banshees will take the young and carefree Aefanyl to wander through valleys and fables. In the light-dappled woods, beneath the gaze of the towering mountains in the distance, they sing ancient epics and extol life's brilliance. Aefanyl, clad in splendorous robes, dances to the songs of the elders. Through these cadences passed down from thousands of years, he hears the footsteps of ancient heroes on their faraway journeys and the breathing of new shoots as they sprout from the trees. His thoughts rise and fall with the sun: this land is an extension of the Convallis, home to laughter and melodies without end.\nA cry draws his attention and jerks him back to reality. On the other side of the river, several tuskbeasts are dragging a cystybeast into the forest's depths, vanishing before he can take a good look. He hears his own panting, along with several strange sounds mixed with the gurgling of the river, as if something is being torn apart, then broken. It is a new language that Aefanyl has never heard before. It seems to contain certain emotions and connotations he has never experienced, and it begins to fill him with confusion.\nHe takes out the bone pen from his breast pocket—his birthday gift—and draws simple symbols in the air. They look like words but are little more than scribbles. He has his own way of recording this new language.\n'Our little hero's great adventure thus reaches its end.' The young Banshee turns his head and sees the dresses of the Banshee elders fluttering in the night, shimmering with the silken strands they had woven themselves.\n'Do you remember what we agreed upon, Aefanyl?'\n'I am not to use Arts while I am alone.'\n'Wonderful.' An older Banshee gently cups Aefanyl's chin and rubs his face with the base of her palm. 'Why, then, did you do what you just did?'\n'I wanted to understand, what the cystybeast was saying just now...' Aefanyl lowers his head, his right hand sliding behind his back as he grips the pen, gently pressing his thumb against its tip, as if trying to conceal it within his palm.\n'If I could figure out what it was saying, would that have prevented it from being taken away by the tuskbeasts? If I understood what it was saying, how it felt, would I have been able to help it and stop it from making that sad sound? I want it to know that someone cares.' Aefanyl recalls what he had just seen. Confusion becomes pain, and from pain comes a wish.\nIn an instant, everyone becomes quiet, and a breeze stirs.\n'From now on,' the Great Banshee Laqeramaline breaks the silence and steps forth from the crowd, 'our Aefanyl is free to go where he pleases, and practice as he pleases.' 'However,' his mother continues, 'it is now time to go to bed.'\n'Mother...' Aefanyl approaches his mother, and her hand lovingly clasp his.\nThe Banshees return the way they had come. Along the way, moonlight elongates Aefanyl's thin figure. They walk in silence, while the leaves of beech, fir, and pine trees rustle softly in the wind. Beneath the deep blue night sky and the misty gray clouds, the river quietly carries the floating light forward, like a crack of luminous light from a black valley, from which a gentle pulse of courage emerges.",

          "description": "Neural stimulants, whether taken orally, injected or inhaled, can temporarily increase one's perceptive and cognitive powers, but become a health risk with long-term usage.\nCoffee serves a similar function to neural stimulants for landwalkers. The creation of coffee involves a complex process whereby the fruit of the coffee plant is processed multiple times using specific techniques, equipment, and procedures.\nThere are many detailed subcategories of coffee products by taste and quality, and the process of its usage is equally complex. Landwalkers consume coffee orally at specified times and occasions, with specific rules for how it is consumed.\nDespite being more harmful than typical neural stimulants, coffee appears to be far less effective. No obvious stimulation effects were observed after consuming ten standard portions of Siracusan espresso. How could such complex manufacturing and usage procedures lead to such a mild effect?\n...\nSystematic research has revealed that the manufacturing and usage of coffee is a terrestrial ritual. The meaning behind the complex manufacturing process is manifested in the form of taste of quality, and perceived by the user when consumed orally. Emphasis on a specific time and place asserts the solemnity of the ritual, while rules about consumption increases the sense of participation. The user is subject to a form of psychic suggestion to stay awake, which compensates for any deficiencies in actual potency.\nWhile the rituals involved are complex and difficult to comprehend, there may be lessons to be learned from the employment of psychic suggestion as a form of mental stimulation. Although the Institute of Development Planning will intervene in the event that an Ægir citizen overuses neural stimulations by rescheduling work or adjusting requirements, individual citizens, out of an obsession for their creative activities or personal values, may occasionally ignore the IDP's intervention and continue to administer neural stimulants in large quantities. While adjustive measures exist to deal with the circumstances of such citizens, there is a need for a less harmful form of neural stimulation to assist them during a creative fever. Progress has been made to reduce the side effects of neural stimulants through technological means, but perhaps we could also investigate the possibility of integrating terrestrial psychic suggestion into the use of neural stimulants, in order to achieve the same effect with a lower dosage...\nWe should leave some of the experiment results for him. He could use it... assuming we don't have to execute him when he comes back.",

          "description": "Lazvar opens the heavy door that has shielded him from people's hostility for more than a decade. Absentmindedly, he grabs the beast teaser hanging behind the door and makes a few flicks towards the inside of the room.\nOne, two, three.\nThe newly-engraved gemstone on the tip of the teaser glows faintly, flickering against the darkness, yet the familiar figure doesn't appear as expected. Lazvar stops. It suddenly dawns on him that Mio is never going to magically emerge from nowhere and rush towards him again. Sighing deeply, he hangs the teaser back.\n'Click.' With a faint mechanical sound, soft light illuminates the depths of the room. Priceless gems, coveted even in Menat-Ha'mait, flood the bookshelves and desks, casting vibrant, colorful reflections. In this most secure and secretive room of the Grand Bazaar, they have silently painted an ethereal illusion.\nThese are the fruits of many years of hard work by Lazvar's family. To protect them from bandits and thieves, Lazvar has memorized the precise position of every brick in these four walls, even noting how they're covered by dust.\nBut none of that matters now, for he is finally going to put his long-carried mission aside and leave this place that has begun to paralyze his mind.\nBefore going, Lazvar needs to pack the most important things first. Wait, what are those things on the list again?\nOh yes, the portrait of Mio, Woof and him from a couple of years ago... Here, right behind the shelf. They persuaded him into getting one as a commemoration of coming-of-age, but after the portrait was completed, Woof insisted on hiding it here, claiming, 'Who has ever seen any beckbeast and cloudbeast as large as us!' Mio was so offended that they refused to eat for two days.\nThat old scratching board of Mio is still under the desk! Actually, it was originally a gemstone pillow they gave him when he was little; after Lazvar fell asleep, Mio would curl up next to his head. Later, the pillow became Mio's scratching board, and so Lazvar wrapped it in a brand-new blanket for them to use.\nOf course, there's also this teasing stick behind the door, which was originally a retractable rod gifted by Woof. It used to have a clockwork fowlbeast attached to it. Mio liked to carry this rod in her mouth, and they would chase each other around the house...\nOther than those things, there's only this pile of gemstones sitting here, their beauty now meaningless to him.\nLazvar takes out a broken clockwork fowlbeast—a prop Mio once used countless times at his bedside to perform their trick of 'swallowing a toy and throwing it up whole again', just to make him laugh. The badly-scratched clockwork fowlbeast now lies quietly in his palm, though. It seems Mio has grown out of these kinds of tricks too.\nLazvar clears the carbon box of exquisite gemstones and refills it with his few cherished memories. After some tugging and bumping, everything falls back into silence.\n'Stop watching. We should leave too.'\nA voice softly rings from a dark corner of the room once Lazvar seems to have gone far enough away.",

An operator selecting daily necessities cannot help but worry as they look at Mitm's bulging shopping bag.\n'I've got a few coupons about to expire, so I need to use them up,' Mitm says, pushing an overflowing shopping cart from behind the shelf.\n'Whoa! Look at all that stuff! I'd better check out now—I don't want to be stuck behind you in line.'\nBy the time Mitm reaches the checkout counter, a crowd had already gathered there, waiting for the show.\nThe logistics operator at the register looked fully prepared. 'Bring it on!' they cry.\nThe scanner beeps nonstop, as the total amount on screen keeps zooming skyward.\n'Your total is... 997.5 LMD!'\n'Hold on a second...' Mitm says as he reaches into the inner pocket of his coat.\n'Planning to pay with your personal operator points? The 5% discount has already been applied.'\nThe crowd offers scattered applause, though the logistics operator shows no sign of relief. He knows the battle has only just begun.\n'Is that so...' Mitm pulls out a large stack of vouchers, all in different colors, from his coat. 'I'd like to use these coupons too, please.'\nThe onlookers begin to murmur with excitement.\n'Limited-time anniversary commemorative discount vouchers, new operator breakfast vouchers... these ones have expired.' The logistics operator carefully sorts through the stack and pulls out the few invalid ones.\nThe scanner beeps again, but this time, the number on the screen begins to drop steadily.\nFifteen minutes later, it displays '103 LMD.' The logistics operator finally smiles. 'Still above 100 LMD. Ha.'\nMitm frowns, scans the area, then fixes his gaze on the clock across from him.\n'Add this.' Mitm picks up a pack of gum and hands it to the logistics operator. 'Also, it's just past 8 PM—after 8, fruit and deli are half-price.'\nThe logistics operator's smile freezes. The number on the display flickers, settling at 84.75.\nThe crowd erupts into cheers.\n'Wait!' The logistics operator isn't ready to give up yet. He eyes the shopping bag hanging from Mitm's tail. 'What about that big bag? I haven't scanned anything in it yet!'\nMitm's expression changes. 'These are personal items!'\n'No, I saw what's in it! A big box of cystymilk and some detergent... that's at least 30 LMD—I haven't lost yet!'\nThe logistics operator lunges forward, while Mitm swings his tail, sending the shopping bag flying.\nThe box of cystymilk spins in the air, the hinge on its side flipping open to reveal hidden blades; the detergent bottle opens wide, revealing a remote-controlled car and an energy reserve unit inside.\nFor a moment, a torrent of blades and metal tools flies everywhere...\n'I told you, they're my personal items!'\n'Who would hide dangerous items in milk cartons and detergent bottles?! Can't you use a normal toolbox like everyone else?'\n'It's called 'camouflage'! If I carried a toolbox, even a kid would know there's a weapon inside.'",

The handwriting's kind of immature, and she doesn't need them to remember what the words mean now, but still she hooks them on her belt, the well-worn eyelet fraying day by day.\n'These ones, I brought from home. The rest, I picked on the outside,' replied Kemar once upon a time, when a Rhodes operator was curious about the flowers on her cards. At first, they were how the girl of the rainforest learned her way through other languages—they fascinated her since she was young. Tender little plants. As enrapturing as a flying fist, and they called to her the way the wild things did.\nOn a certain level, these flowers held more strength than any brave warrior. Their names and stories were some of the earliest things Kemar knew by heart: learning how the people beyond the rainforest colored the four seasons with them, interpreted their lives with them. What describes these flowers now are no longer unfamiliar words, but a ring of keys, hung on her waist, opening each of Terra's doors alongside her.\n'Look well, it's our tribe's tallest, mightiest warrior! Her footprints are left in places even our imaginations couldn't reach! And now, she's back!' Kemar parts the grass weave over the doorway, and is met headon with the eager chatter of her tribesfolk, in her native language. Eventually, she stirs; in this most familiar of rainforests, she'll never be needing any 'key'.\nThe tribe's kiddies mill around Kemar, jabbing zealously at all the names on her flashcards' flowers, pestering her to tell all her stories from beyond the forest.\n'Beyond the rainforest... it's very wide.'\nKemar recalls the most exciting moment of her own language-learning Not the first time she understood a spoken word. Not being able to fluently converse with Big Boss Blaze. It was when she realized she could finally explain to others, coherently and clearly, the things that all the flowers of her home represented.\n'...But don't let me tell you about it. You should all go see it for yourself!\n'And then face off with the people outside, and tell them... let them know how mighty we are.' Kemar flips back to the very first flashcard, pressed with a flower of the rainforest. Its power to live is unwavering, and its power to adapt is unrivalled. Rainforest, prairie, or barrens, it will bloom more avidly, more ardently than all.",

Testing, restoration and upgrades of all-new energy emission devices in the training grounds\n3. Improved designs for remote-control drone swarm weapon mounting plans.\n4. Servicing of Rhodes Island Landship automated navigation systems.\n5. Self-researched planning for some machine hyper-remodeling, audited and launched with the Engineering Department.\n......\n12. Daily maintenance, painting, and emotional communication with and guidance of intelligent operation platform Lancet-2 (note: applied for by Operator herself and not conducted under official Engineering Department authority. Engineering Department does not interfere excessively in light of Lancet-2's behavioral non-rejection of Eunectes).\n......\nOverall evaluation:\nOperator Eunectes has participated in multiple projects and displayed impressive performance in all aspects since joining the Engineering Department, and now tentatively possesses the capacity to research, develop and work independently.\n......\nSupplement from Officer-in-Charge (directly dictated):\nJeez, do we have to make these evaluations so formal every time? Could be doing WORK here... If someone's my disciple, they're worth educating. She learned how to test microcapacitor unit performance and then straight away, she managed to fumble a whole breadboard together! She's gifted! Really resembles me there! And she's hardworking. Read through every single engineering book the landship has over the past half year, and she finds people to discuss with everywhere. They don't put half of the true might of technology to print, though. She's got a lot more to learn. As for why she's so eager, well, don't ask me. Probably hasn't scooped her jaw up from the floor since she landed on Rhodes Island... She's had two sorta major awakenings in her life, right? First was seeing a nomadic city pass by with her own eyes when she was a kid, second was seeing a talking Lancet-2 in Acahualla. I can see the hopes in her, for machines, for herself. There's a possibility in there... in the not-distant future, I bet she'll be able to build machines with her own two hands that surprise even herself. Maybe her creations will lead Terra in technological innovation. I might just hand my Chief Engineer position to her when the time comes, it's not out of the question... That last one was a joke, don't write it down.\n\nDate: Dec 13\nApprover: Closure",

          "description": "Just what were those massive things sailing across the barrens? Zumama couldn't figure it out, try as she might over three straight sleepless nights.\nGavial saw the heavy bags under Zumama's eyes, and on one hand showed the appropriate concern, while the other hand was clenched in a fist as unreserved as ever. Zumama crashed to the floor, but showed no hurry to get back up.\n'Old Man Zuluzhak said those things were nomadic cities. What's a nomadic city?' Zumama asked as she stared up at the blue sky, giving her friend the same question that had been bothering her for three whole days. She'd never been this hung up before. Even the mushrooms she'd never seen before growing on trees only lingered on her mind for a day and a half.\nGavial gave an answer she considered incredibly wise, a saying she'd heard from Old Man Zuluzhak. 'It is why it is, and that's why it is.' Then she started pumping her arms. 'You rested enough, Zumama? Let's keep going!'\nZumama suddenly felt a little listless. She got up, and walked off to where the nomadic city had sailed past. Its outline was still faintly visible, but her eyes could see far further than her feet could take her. How could a child's gait ever catch up to a sailing machine? Sunset came, and she felt the distance between her and the nomadic city hadn't narrowed one bit.\nShe felt somewhat dejected, and gloomily sat on the ground, but bumped against something as she did. From underneath her, she pulled out a strange metallic ring. Zumama had once witnessed the most experienced boy of the tribe show off roughly the same thing. What was it called, again? A short name... a 'nud'? Maybe a 'nup'?\nZumama put it in her pocket. It was likely the thing hadn't even come off the nomadic city—it was just some careless traveler's dropped belonging—but all the same, Zumama loved it, very much.\nShe began to collect these abandoned and scrapped metal parts, putting them together with no principle whatsoever. At first, she bound them with thread, then stuck them together with glue, until she eventually learned from a passing caravan what welding was.\nFinally, one day, this strange little contraption was born from Zumama's hands. Gavial and Tomimi's verdict was 'ugly', but still, she loved it, very much.\nShe clasped it in her hands, and came to where she once saw that nomadic city. It had long since vanished, but Zumama always had a feeling she could sense the tremors from it as it sailed.\nSuddenly, a strange Liberi showed up beside her, and asked, 'What's on your mind there, young lady?'\nShe tightly gripped the tiny, ugly little thing in her hands, so hard her fingers hurt.\n'I want to make it move.'",

And maybe, some time next year, the pinecones that fell intact would find a completely new life in the ash-blanketed earth... just as she did.\nShe had to live on, in the stead of her friends and family who lost their lives to Catastrophe. She had to plant roots and bud in the soil they named Kazimierz. Such notions kept her driven to the present day.\nBut before she knew it, Sona was shaking her head free of them all. They skipped too many steps—they would only trap her in more regrettable circumstances. She couldn't go on like this. She had to learn to be optimistic. Shape up her act, and perhaps the merchants would give her an out, and employ this little Infected girl to do what handiwork she could.\nSoon after, she learned from newspapers and television that Infected, too, could be knights. She was going to find a way in. Still, she wanted to become one just so she could make a living. With no chivalric spirit of old turned life lesson, and no grand visions or hopes, Sona clenched her fist tight.\nBut the next thing she knew, she was being forced to raise it against fellow Infected who deserved it just as little.\nSona wasn't strong, but she was nimble. She stood out amongst the Infected for it, and was selected by the bankroller of an underground power and sent into the 'cleaning qualifiers.' No weapon in hand, danger surrounding her, and a single fist planted in her foe's face. And they toppled, and Sona won the right to survive another day—but she wasn't happy. She wasn't strong. Taking her opponent down in one blow... it could only be because they were starving, because the evening before, their backer 'tipped' a few knights some bonds to get into a brawl with them.\nSona wasn't happy. She wasn't strong.\nSome fawned, telling her if she just dressed up a little, she'd be so cute, so lovely and sweet. Some gushed, telling her if she just went through some proper training, she'd be a terror of the racetrack.\nUntil one voice told her: 'You've got a tail like a blazing fire.' It caught her off guard.\nThere was nothing in particular beneath that statement, and it was no more than an ordinary spectator, reveling in the violence, who yelled it.\nBut it was the first time Sona had ever choked with emotion after a match.\nYes. She'd just realized it. She ought to be like a blazing fire.",

          "description": "Why do people like to drink?\nWhen Rafaela first began her bartending job, the question floated to her mind from time to time.\nShe can always ask her papá when she has a question. But this is a work thing—Papá usually barely talks to her about his work, so likewise, she'd better not ask him about hers.\nAnd she doesn't want to ask her hermano about it.\nEspecially not her hermano.\nSo she'll ask a customer! People are always coming and going in Dossoles, but in just a short time, Rafaela's learned to recognize a lot of regulars, and they all like to talk to her.\nAccording to the person dancing wildly to the jota while calling her 'Rafa' and 'chica' at the top of their lungs, you drink for the color, the mouthfeel, the taste, and for a moment of joy.\nBut according to the person calling her 'Señorita Silva' while leaning on the bar counter, sluggishly lifting a hand as they sing fado, you drink just to forget and be free from your worries for a while.\n'Thanks for asking,' they add more often than not.\nRafaela isn't sure if she comprehended all these answers, but she makes sure to remember every one. It's how it should be, she thinks.\nTimes change.\nAs the landship sails, there's a regular thrumming all throughout the hold. Rafaela hasn't gotten used to this noise yet—after all, it's nothing like fowlbeast chirps or beating waves—but she doesn't react badly to it at all.\nShe's asked another operator before, and now she knows this is how it should be on the ship.\nIn the landship, music is more varied too, with lots she's never heard before.\nEven so, the person who dances wildly while calling her 'Rafa' and 'chica' at the top of their lungs is still there. When she meets this kind of person, she does as they request, and squeezes some of the sweetest fruit juice into their drinks, adding some of the most bracing syrup. But at the same time, she secretly dilutes these flavors until they make for the coolest, most reinvigorating flavors. She gives whoever's drinking it a moment of joy, and all the wake-up they need to bask in that joy.\nAnd there's still the person who calls her 'Señorita Silva' and 'Miss La Pluma' while leaning on the bar counter, sluggishly lifting a hand. When she meets this kind of person, she does as they quietly ask her, and pulls the strongest, most biting bottles from the racks to pour into their glass. But at the same time, she doesn't forget to mix in a little of the finest pedigree, sourced locally from Logroño. She watches them down a glass of bitter drink, but knows the taste left behind won't be totally astringent.\n'Thank you,' they say in approval more often than not. Sometimes she nods, but feels strange about it, so other times she just doesn't nod at all.\nOf course, this method of mixology isn't entirely described in the Dossoles Guide to Cocktails, but she makes a note of it in there herself.\nAnd she's already given the book away to someone who deserves it. She may not have it anymore, but she's learned it by heart.\nRafaela feels that this way is good.\nThis is how it should be.",

          "description": "Maggy, I got your pictures, thank you. The aurora's so pretty, so... stunning. Sorry I can't find better words. I saw the other material you sent back from Rhodes Island too. That little yellow flower! I never knew flowers that pretty could grow in the extreme north, all the way in the ice deserts! It's unbelievable, really.\nYou suggested I should 'join the next exploration project as a supporting surveyor,' right? I've given serious thought to it. Not whether to go or not—I still have to stay on the landship at this stage so I can get Oripathy treatment. It's what help I would be if I did go. Mayer's said how under extreme cold conditions, your Soaring Dragon drones get their stability affected. I minored in research filming while I was studying at Ironforge Polytechnic, so I tried installing a set of production lenses on my shield, so it could handle photography and data storage roles at certain temperatures. I should be able to take my shield through more special terrain, compared to using drones, and use it for fundamental defense work. It can sort out the issue of stability, too.\n......\nMaggy, I admire you, with all my heart. While everyone only has the barest imagining of what such faraway places are like, you've gone deep into them, gotten a taste of all this fascinating scenery, felt the pulse of life. I once went with a survey group into the northern icefields and saw the aurora, and that was when I learned a really important lesson in life: not every place has snowy peaks like Kjerag, and protection like Kjeragandr's, but every place has its own beauty you can't explain with common sense. The Black Flow forests, the Ringed Plains with mountains all around... all these extreme landscapes have nothing to do with the supernatural, really. They're part of Terra in themselves. I can't help but wonder, just how—shallow and narrow everything we know and hear and think and believe about this great land is.\nI want to see the aurora again more than anything else. I want to go and see the ice deserts. Not so I can prove anything—just because, well, 'I want to go and see.' Master SilverAsh is right. If we want to protect Kjerag, then we have to know just what kind of world it is we live in.\nWe can only better defend the homeland behind us if we're brave enough to explore onward. And besides, I have this sort of feeling, like the ice deserts, the poles, all these places full of hidden secrets far away already have a lot of eyes watching them... \nSo once I'm ready, Maggy, you can be sure I'll submit my application to the Doctor.\n......\nI eat... a little bigger, and I sleep more as well, but you don't need to worry, I promise. When it comes work time, I'll get down to it, believe me. I'm sure I'll be able to help you out.\n\n—Extract from comms logs sent to Operator Magallan by Operator Aurora",

          "description": "Truth be told, Kowal has a dream. He'd already made the kid's come true.\nOnce, Maria was viewing her ancestor's portraits by Margaret and Auntie Zofia's sides, listening to them tell legends of Kazimierzian knights of old. She lifted her head and asked her sister: 'Is the armor they wear the same as yours?'\nMargaret smiled and shook her head.\nThen Maria asked: 'What about the sword?'\nUnable to hold back a laugh, Zofia decided they'd pay a visit to Kowal's knight workshop while the weather was still good.\nThat afternoon, Maria saw Master Kowal hard at work in his shop. He was always a friend to his friends, and on occasion boisterous too.\n'If a knight's honor really be measured in a crown, then that crown's going to be made by the Craftsman's Guild,' Kowal laughed, as he picked Maria up.\nMaria didn't mind the smell of iron at all. She watched the delighted expressions flit across her sister and aunt's faces as they looked over the weapon, and her eyes shone brilliantly.\nLuckier still, she just so happened to be deft at the very thing she was interested in, which raised her spirits.\n'She's a jack-of-all-trades, I tell you,' Kowal said, wiping the foam from his mouth. 'Say, remember when we were holding that lone city out on the plains? Remember all that work the old one-eyed boy from the blacksmith's got up to, and we thought he was just some nobody? If it weren't for him, we'd have caved before reinforcements arrived!'\n'Of course I remember! How could I forget!' The old knight's face was aglow at the mention of tales of the past, and even his own drunkenness slipped his mind. 'But what're you saying? Maria could match that, no contest!'\nKowal would normally have fired a retort at his old friend out of habit, but as that stretch of the past washed over him, and he remembered the brothers-in-arms they'd lost, he fell quiet. His silence said enough though, and V took a swig of his drink before lowering his voice. 'What d'you think of her, that Maria girl?'\n'Me?' Kowal came back to his senses, went briefly blank, then let out a huge grin. 'If Maria'd been around back then, holding the city would've been nothing. Could've even counterattacked! And done it damn well.'\nV said nothing. He simply returned his own grin.\nFor the banished Margaret had come to mind.\nMaria had cried for days and nights, even wailing about how she'd go find her sister herself. It was Zofia who soothed her to sleep, and kept her company at home.\nKowal loathed himself for doing an awful job of protecting the Nearl family, and was ashamed of what old man Kirill might've thought. All these years, he'd hardly done any work himself.\nRust. Creeping across the surface of this radiant, beautiful city. Yet the old boys could hardly do a thing anymore.\n'I'd give anything to hear those lively sounds a-banging away again. We need that girl's hands...' Kowal mumbles to himself.\n'...Too much to drink, methinks?'\n'No, like this, you see.'\nKowal sidesteps the question and gesticulates with his hands, as if he's holding a hammer, and the scene outside the tent's a thousand miles of grassland lapping at the white clouds, and the lumber and the stones pile up high amidst the sounds of knocking, forming a grand castle.\nClank—\nRinging through the air.",

          "description": "This is a dream. Maria can tell.\nAn unfamiliar host is straightening out their formal attire, ice-cold light shrouding the entire venue, but the night sky is a million miles away, and the superfluous bustle envelops her.\nShe turns her head, only to see expressionless campaign knights. Their silver armor appears dazzling—they nod to send her their regards. Some elderly people step up, reading out indistinct sentences. She sees the Grand Knight Russell, a hair older than everyone else, the hero in her twilight, under her ceremonial guard's escort, approaching her bearing a shield.\nMaria recognizes this shield. Engraved with the crest of the Nearls, wrapped in the banner of the Nearls, it could not be any more familiar to her. Maria knows what this signifies, and she feels a sense of bewilderment. Her uncle didn't want her becoming the Knight Primus, and her sister didn't want to acknowledge the modern knight institution. So what should she do?\nOr... what does she want to do?\nMaria hurriedly looks around. Her sister's not there. Her auntie isn't there. Uncle Młynar, V, Master Kowal, Marcin, none of them are there. She wants to run, but rationality lashes her to the spot. This is a major occasion. She can't shrink away, even if this isn't how she wanted it.\nNerves and unease momentarily catapult Maria into reminiscence. It's a workshop breathing with sizzling heat, and she's forging a brand new sword for her sister Margaret. V and Master Kowal are bickering as ever—Zofia lovingly wipes her forehead to take off the sweat, and tidies up her disheveled hair. Młynar is in the shade of a tree not far away, silently watching over it all, and on the other side of the street, long since lost to her childhood memories, are her father, mother, and the one who'd left only the shadow of a lance behind at the fringes of her hopes, old Grandpa Nearl...\n'From this day forth, you are Knight Primus of the Nearl family.'\nMaria accepts the shield, and its solitary weight leaves her lost at sea. She feels as if she's still in that vision. She's still poring over blueprints, operating the furnace. She doesn't want to forge mail to amuse the people, nor lances to slaughter the innocent.\nShe wants to forge an 'ideal.' An 'ideal' to protect the ones she loves, to become a hero's strength, to brace herself upright, never to dread confusion and solitude.\nThe clanging of steel on steel still rings in her ears. Engulfing the cheers, engulfing the glory.\n'Maria.' A familiar voice softly calls to her.\nShe lifts her head, and at this moment the clamorous arena holds not a soul in sight.",

          "description": "Having hastily finished his dinner, Hohenlohe has just about stepped into his villa's quarters for the night when Carnelian appears behind him without warning.\n'What are you doing here so late?'\n'You had worries, and I've just seen to them. I'm here to report in, of course.'\n'Oh, I see.'\nA gust of night air blows through the room, mile-long curtains fluttering restlessly. Having left his Spire for the moment so as to smooth out tomorrow's parade, the Count feels the air faintly nip at him.\n'Hold on, what made you—no, let me restate. Can you even <i>be</i> that quick?'\n'Of course.'\n'Really? Well, I'll make one more check, just on the off-chance. Given tomorrow's parade, you—'\n'Off-chance? Don't you have faith in me?'\n\nMuch like one would enrage at a habitually interrupting bodyguard, the Count stomps his feet forcefully.\n'How could I have faith? Are you to say an instrument can be so quickly learned? What, did you take up the triangle?'\n'You surmise well.'\n'Do I now? You plan to show up to my parade tomorrow tinkling on the triangle?!'\n'Exactly. And by the way, all triangle lovers take grave offense at your words.'\n'You—! You might recall I had every other bodyguard playing <i>music</i> at last year's visits, while you alone stood there doing nothing, making us all look like fools!'\n'And <i>you</i> insisted I act like a member of the bodyguards last month, when an envoy came from the next city over. If you'll remember, when he affixed a tapping device under the table, I drew my weapon across his throat by reflex <i>before</i> remembering I was holding a trumpet, not a sword.'\n'Carnelian!!'\n'I'll be blunt—looking after you takes enough of my energy. I'm certainly not disposed to learn an instrument for you.'\n'I don't care! I demand you learn! I demand it!'\nThe Count glares at his unrepentant attendant with all the temper of a small child, ultimately not so furious as to pounce at anything—he simply slams the door as he leaves.\n\nBut the moment the door latches shut, Carnelian places a firm grip on the dagger at her waist.\n'Alright, you behind the curtain. Come out.\n'An assassin sent by the diet, I presume? And you really think that once the Count is dead and his cousin succeeds the title in all his ambition, he'll grant the Stadtrat autonomy?\n'No. Forget that. Here's a different question. Would you prefera sophisticated death, or one more to-the-point?\n'...Well, if you won't say anything, can I take that as the dealer's choice?'\nThe assassin barely has time to twitch before the curtain becomes a pair of lips, the bookshelves jaws, and the candles incisors. One massive chomp on their windowside prey is followed by chewing, then a swallow, and finally a mess all over the floor.\n\n'It's over now. Won't you come in?'\nThe Count pokes his head through the door to confirm that all danger has passed, then musters all his courage before entering.\n'Very swift to react, and on-point with the improvisation as well. Quite well done.'\n'I don't need you complimenting me.'\nThe two of them stare at the villa bedroom, a scene of chaos and scraps and fresh blood, neither breaking the silence.\nIt isn't the first unsuccessful assassination attempt, but all previous ones have taken place at Count Hohenlohe's Spire, which is hardly dilapidated enough to let would-be murderers as far as the sleeping quarters.\nAfter a spell, the Count breaks the tension.\n'Carnelian.'\n'What? I can't exactly use my Arts to clean rooms.'\n'And I wasn't expecting you to.'\n'Good call.'\n'I wanted to ask, are you really not going to learn an instrument?'\n'Oh? So you <i>are</i> scared of losing face after all?'\n'As if! No, it's no more than a bit of curiosity. You—'\nThe Count's face flushes red. He stammers silently. Eventually, having not said a word further, he turns to flee the bedroom.\nCarnelian shakes her head. The hyacinths by the head of the bed catch her eye. In front of them lies an implement nominally for self-defense, but hardly useful in practice, save for offering the Count a little mental assurance—a dagger.\nThough yet to nestle in anyone's flesh, blood has dyed its blade a deep carmine.",

          "description": "Sargonian has a noun to describe a very particular emotion, 'the pleasant surprise of finding the familiar in somewhere strange.' In this, you can see the significance of the local accent to Sargonians. However, one time, Beeswax made a sudden appearance in a Leithanian restaurant where she seated herself right across the table from her sister, and as Carnelian's hand slowly fell from her in-ear comms terminal, her expression flickered with rare alarm.\n'S... Surprise? Heheh...'\nIn a snap, Carnelian shut off her receiver.\nIt wasn't as if Beeswax forgot her sister's advice to keep away from Leithanien. Abashed, she explained that she was just passing through. A paper-thin lie; Carnelian could already imagine which Rhodes Island operator had needlessly put her up to the task.\nShe wasn't especially dismayed, of course. She positively coddled Ankhesena, indulging every anecdote from her journey, their table the picture of love and peace. Meanwhile, in her ear, a very different picture was being painted.\n'Boss! Do you copy! The target's about to enter the Arts Circle focus!'\n'She was laying low, right?! Did shit go down at the restaurant?!'\n'Sis, what's that buzzing coming from your ear?'\n'Oh, it's just music. The Leithanians aren't half bad at it. You'd like it.'\n'Boss! Are you there?!'\nCarnelian sighed and got up. 'It's a little noisy, though. Give me a moment to go and adjust it.'\nThe 'music' her sister mentioned caused Beeswax some turmoil. It'd been years since they last met, during which this strange country had clearly changed her sister—for someone accustomed to the most beautiful melodies, would she really like whatever <i>that</i> was? Beeswax clutched her bundle tight, too shy to open it.\nCarnelian returned, astonishingly quickly. She took off her terminal, finally able to show a relieved smile.\n'What about your music, Sis?'\n'It's over. I have more important things still waiting for me to sample—'\nA word from home, to signify an emotion. Fit to describe the soothing, settling look in Carnelian's eyes, as if by some Originium Arts... It blew Beeswax's worries away. At last, she pulled the item of the hour out of her bag—a plain Sargonian sistrum, distinctly out of place in Leithanien.\n'Oh! And I thought you'd lost that forever ago! That's the only instrument I can even play.'\nJingle, jangle. The warm, rustic sound of home.\n'That takes me back. It's what I always soothed you with when you were little. Do you still remember that?'\n'Your work must be really important, what you're doing in Leithanien.'\n'What? No, I've only been...'\n'Remember to stop sometimes, and listen to it, okay? Just sometimes... when you're too busy to reply, and you don't have time to visit home, just listen to it...'\nCarnelian relented, her gaze turning soft. <i>Alright, I'll remember to write back, and I'll make my way home again as soon as I can,</i> she wanted to say. But she didn't make that promise—it's one she had no idea when she'd be able to keep, if ever. Instead, she picked up the sistrum and gave it a light shake.\nHow very, very curious. Here, in a Leithanian restaurant, she could almost hear the rustling of the leaves on Sargon's trees... She and Ankhesena always liked to call it the forest playing to them. They used to love it.",

          "description": "The shoe-shiner trembles as he enters the Bellone famiglia parlor.\nHe trembles not because this is Bellone territory. He had shined Bernardo's shoes for thirty years, and the man always respected those who respected him. The last time he had stepped into this parlor, it was so that he could offer Bernardo the chance to name his son.\nHis fear comes from the fact that the one sitting here today is not Bernardo, but his son, Leontuzzo.\nHe has not heard much about the Bellone heir. All he knew was that the young master had never come to him for a shoe shining.\n'My father isn't here at the moment, but you can trust me as you trusted him.'\nHis words calm him a bit, allowing the shoe-shiner to explain why he had no choice but to come:\nHis son leads a decent, honorable life, and fell in love with a lady from Columbia. However, that lady was also being pursued by a maniac who didn't take kindly to a rival. Three nights ago, his son was cornered by that maniac and beaten within an inch of his life. He'd sought aid from the courts, but the man belonged to a Columbian famiglia, and his lawyers were easily able to secure a 'not guilty.'\n'When I was leaving the courtroom, he stepped in front of me and shoved two banknotes into my pocket. He laughed as he told me it was for my son's medical fees. I...' The shoe-shiner went on, tears streaming from his wizened eyes.\nLeontuzzo listens in silence. He knows that if his father were here, he would surely give the old man a pat on the shoulder, acknowledge his suffering, then provide a solution to this. A humane way.\nGenerally speaking, these things could only be resolved with bloodshed.\nBut that was not how he does things.\n'What is it you wish for, signor?'\n'I have no requests, Don Leontuzzo, other than justice for my boy.'\n'Justice. Am I to understand that you want this man to feel the same pain your son did?'\n'That's right. Nothing more.'\nLeontuzzo snaps his fingers, and a red-headed young man steps out from a door to the side.\n'Demetri, go investigate the gang behind that guy first.'\n'Easy enough, but what comes next?'\n'Next... If I'm not mistaken, those Columbian gangs want to sidestep us and cozy up to the local government. Then let's propose sending local 'talents' to the Columbian frontier. Hopefully, every famiglia will enthusiastically agree. Let them send off a few stronzi who should have been exiled long ago.'\nThe red-headed youth snaps his fingers. 'So we'll ship this guy off too?'\n'Exactly.'\n'Capisco.'\nWith that final declaration, the man leaves the room. Leontuzzo turns towards the astonished shoe-shiner. 'This is the justice I can give you. Are you satisfied with it, signor?'\nThe shoe-shiner quickly catches on, and his gaze turns from astonishment to gratitude.\n'Take this.'\n'This is...'\n'My pistola. Place it by your shoe-shiner, and nobody will cause you trouble.'\n'But—'\n'Don't worry. I barely use it. Whenever you feel like you can sleep easy again, just give it back to the guard downstairs.'",

They're here to watch the match. \nMy first time competing in the knight tournament. \nThis is different from when I was in the underground arena... This is an official match. \n...Different? \nI've become an official Infected Knight, but does this really make a difference compared to before? \n...... \n......Soon. \nThere's not much time left. The match will start soon. \nI... \nI know, I will win. \nI will win...... \n...... \n\nExcuse me, is Miss Justyna Valentine here? We've brought your custom-made equipment! \nHuh, is Miss Valentine not here? \nShe... hasn't been seen since noon? What do you mean nobody knows where she is? The match is about to begin, and she's still not back yet? \nThis is quite unfortunate. Being late to her debut match will surely leave a bad taste in the fans' mouths. This certainly won't do any favors for Miss Valentine's future career! \nAnd in addition to that, she's going to need to personally look over her custom equipment, and if she's not here... \nHuh? Wait, what's that sound? \nHmm... Is that... somebody playing the flute? \n\nThe soft melody of the flute was gently carried along the wind, far, far away. \nEver higher, ever further away. \nThe wind continued to blow, to the place I promised to return to. \nPlease, take this tune back with you. \nPlease tell everyone. \nThat Justyna has finally become a knight. \nBut don't tell anyone. \nThat Justyna sorely misses her home. \n\n......\n......My goodness, how long have I been here?! \nI shouldn't be spacing out like that! Who has the time to sit around leisurely, playing a bland country tune? \nWell, whatever. \nThere's not much time left, I've gotta find Miss Valentine, and fast!",

          "description": "To the incredible Ms. Justyna,\n\nI'm a loyal fan of yours!\n...I'm really sorry, I just don't know how to start this letter off. I've almost filled up the wastebasket with scrapped drafts at this point. In the end, I think that cliche is the only thing I can really write.\n\nThis is the first time in my life I'm writing a letter to a hero of mine. You said during an interview that you read every single letter from your supporters, and I know you wouldn't lie!\nFirst, I want to congratulate you on getting the title 'Fartooth,' it's so incredibly cool! I was there for your match with Feather Knight, the sight of you winning without any backup at all touched all of us there! It's only right you were #1 in the season!\nEver since I first saw a match of yours three years ago, I got really into you as a knight. You might not remember, but I was sat in the front row of the grandstand, and the knight who was against you slipped up with a move and almost hurt the audience, but then you blocked it even though you were injured. Among the people you saved, the ones behind you, were me and my family.\nEver since then, you've been an inspirational figure for me. You're a true knight, Ms. Justyna, I'm surer of that than anything. I was still a student then, and if I studied good enough and my grades got better, my family would reward me by taking me to see your matches. I could say you were the one who gave me the drive to keep heading forwards.\n\nI want to become a glorious knight like you so much! Knights would never point their arrowheads at the defenseless, and I don't believe you'd ever use violence against any Knightclub's fans!\nThe 'Fartooth' Knight Justyna I know doesn't concede even when she's hurt, and never talks down to other knights even in the arena. I, along with your other supporters, don't believe any of that slander against you, so please don't take those irresponsible newspaper reports to heart! We're all looking forward to you returning as soon as you can!\nAlso, when I heard you say you wanted to start your own Knightclub, I was over the moons! You always ran solo in the past, and sometimes you looked sort of lonely, so it made me and a lot of other fans really worried... In the end, whether you start your own Knightclub, join another one, or stay active as an independent knight, we'll always support you as long as it's your decision, Ms. Justyna!\nWe hope everything goes well for you!\n\nYour faithful supporter",

          "description": "As evening fell, the crowd receded from both ends of the street, revealing the snow-covered pavement. Greynuty hesitated for a moment before finally taking a step onto it.\n'Slippery, very slippery, you could fall.' That was the first thought that popped into her head.\nImmediately thereafter, the second thought emerged: 'It might be fun, if I don't fall.'\nThrough her sunglasses, Greynuty cautiously surveyed her surroundings. The street was long, offering considerable distance for a run-up. It was also deserted, with no one to witness her.\n'One, two, three!' Taking a few steps back, she braved the cold wind and sprinted forward, accelerating as she went, then abruptly halted, letting momentum carry her forward in a slide.\nShe then started running again, heading toward the other end of the long street. One meter, two meters, three meters... The speed of her running and sliding increased with each attempt, and her heart rate accelerated with the rhythm of her sprint, bringing a sense of weightlessness. The lightness of her body felt almost as if she were floating down a flowing river.\nThe river of time.\n'Don't be afraid, try to go faster, we'll catch you.' In a trance, amidst the whistling wind in her ears, she heard a familiar encouragement. Similar scenes awakened from dusty childhood memories. At the end of the road, a couple smiled and opened their arms to her.\nSo this time, she began to sprint with all her might, only to be brought back to reality by a stone under her foot.\nAfter plunging headfirst into a snowdrift by the roadside, she didn't rush to get up, but instead held her face in her hands. Unsure whether she'd grazed her eyebrow or cheek, she felt a dampness around her eyes.\n'Need a hand getting up, Ashley?' A figure blocked the setting sun, reaching out to her.\n'How did you end up here?' She placed her hand in hers.\nShe stood up, brushed the snowflakes off herself, and picked up her sunglasses and hat that had scattered nearby.\n'You went out for some beer. But it was getting late and you didn't come back, so I was worried. Had to come out to check on you.'\n'*Cough* I'm fine.'\n'Don't lie, your eyes are really red.'\n'The sun's just too bright.'\n'The sun's down.'\n'...Thanks for helping me up.' She put her hat and sunglasses back on, covering her reddened eyes and cheeks.\n'You're welcome.'\n'Oh, actually, there's no point in you arming up like that, Ashley.'\n'Why not?'\n'That shop on the corner there has a special window. You can't see in from the outside, but you can see out from the inside.'\n'So you mean...'\n'Yep... chock full of people. I even saw a few of your fans in there.'",

They just won't drop it—it's driving me insane.'\n'Their leader was the last president, right? Put in some rule about only taking students from good families, and kept nitpicking Gantt for his background. Screwed with us so bad we couldn't even study properly? We ended up kicking him out, didn't we? The teacher was so happy his tail was on overdrive the next few days, not that he'd say.\n'C'mon, Gantt, no more eatin' alone. We'll eat with you. You missed it, but we kicked their butts up and down the field today. Scared 'em shitless!'\n'Just smiled, didn't you, Gantt? Knew that'd cheer you up. No need to hide next time they come mess with you—they'll have to go through us!'\n'What? Stop the drill a sec, Gantt, I didn't catch that. You said you wanna treat us to three days meals? C'mon, man, you don't need to be treatin' us to food just for winnin' a game. Three whole days, even? What, you're seriously saying it's that valuable to you? Listen, how's about you check on my refits for me, and we cut it down to two days. Deal?\n'Hold on, Gantt, you promised if I checked on your installations you'd write my report for me, and you never did! The teacher damn near plucked my feathers clean the day we had to turn it in! That's one meal you owe me!\n'What, I cut class thirteen times and you had to sign me in each time, that's why you dropped the report?'\n'Well, then, here's bad news for everyone! We figured for last month's applications we just had to pull the ole' man's heartstrings, get a little more funding, right? But Gantt couldn't pull it off, so that's one less Ultimate Frisbee, isn't it?'\n'The ole' man says he's immune to Gantt waggin' his tail now? Dang, that's bad—gah, where happened to the lights? Was it the breakers?'\n'What's that smell?'\n'Gantt! Your installation's on fire!'\n......\n'It's out! And I say firefighting's worth at least two meals!'\n'Quit apologizin', whatcha sorry for? This place is blowin' up daily, just treat us twice and we're good!'\n'Do any other teams deal in food and reports and frisbees like we do? Didn't you come up with this too, Gantt?\n'Alright, I get it, the idea of money changing hands between us doesn't sit with you. Relax, okay? Adding some cash to the equation wouldn't change a thing, y'know. But it's fine, yeah? Whatever you're comfortable with.\n'So, then, like we said, you check on my equipment here, and I compensate you with—a month of food, two maintenance checkups, a report, and three rounds of Ultimate Frisbee?! Hold on, lemme check my math!\n'Huh, what, what? What're you patting my shoulder all serious for?\n'You'd still help me without any compensation? And that goes for the entire team? No matter when?\n'Because we're the first pile of friends you ever made? Well, hell! You for real, Gantt?'\n'...Hold on, who counts their friends in 'piles,' huh? Hahaha!

We all muttered how it was some devil's witchcraft silently spreading about, and so we all kept our houses tightly shut. But we didn't have the heart to throw a single frail woman back into the wild in the rainstorm, so we agreed to let her in.\nThe first moment she laid eyes on Veitch, she sensed something was wrong. She was prudent as we worked through his symptoms with her, and she asked how the village at large was doing, before revealing herself to be a roving doctor.\n'This is no Originium Arts; it's an illness. The soil and wellwater is contaminated, and the children are the first to be sick; as the poisoning builds up over time, the adults will come to show symptoms too.'\nShe opened her suitcase, and mixed a medicine with practiced hands. As she did, she spoke. 'I'm sorry. All I can give myself is a temporary first aid, but the only way to cure an illness such as this is to be away from the contamination's source, and convalesce through medication in the long-term. If possible, I'd ask you to tell all the village that they should move away from here.'\n'But this is our home,' my husband said with worry. 'Even if this soil will harm us, where are we going to shelter if we leave here?'\nThe doctor said nothing more. She worked in simple silence.\n\nThe weather had cleared up the next day, and I found the doctor just as she was about to leave. On the door was stuck a wild flower, a kind that grew anywhere. In that instant, a faint memory of someone seemed to match with her in my head.\n'I remember you, doctor. I've met you before.'\n'I was still in a small town on the outer edge of a nomadic city. You'd make home visits to everyone, and you always secretly handed out fresh flowers to us children... I was behind the curtains watching, I remember seeing from there.'\n'That was decades ago by now. My mother caught Oripathy, see and we were driven out... and I've gone from a child to a married woman now, I know you wouldn't recognize me. But, well, you look about the same now, compared to all the way back then.'\nI told her how grateful I was for her, from the bottom of my heart, for she cured me of my fever when I was young, and now she'd saved my own child too. Yet the look on her face was at first blank, then became so sorrowful, as if she was close to weeping.\n'No, please... don't go on any further. Just treat me as though I'd never visited before.'",

But when the tip of his tongue touched upon the Herald's gift, and he kept all to himself, was not drowned in the voice of we many, and did not become a lowly Sea Terror, I conceded that this may have changed things.\nI was meant to prevent that unfortunate plundering, but I did not do so. I watched as those bandits bared their vice. I hold myself in contempt for this inaction of mine. Even if it was to ensure a qualified test subject, to probe at the possibilities for humanity.\nI'm sure the child became aware in time that I could have saved everyone, but one as smart as him has no need to seek answers from me. Yes, he is smart and studious, but he has no reverence for knowledge, nor does he treat it as a simple tool. He seems an uninvolved bystander, examining all he witnesses. Perhaps this is the reason he did not lose himself in his bond to the Herald's flesh. Were he of different birth, he may well have been a scholar of his own school.\nOriginally, no change seemed to occur in the child's body, to the extent I doubted my own research, thereafter deciding to prolong my observation of him. This lasted until he finally found that group of bandits, and cut the flesh from himself to give to them, inquiring if it was their lives plagued of hunger that led them to do evil, and if upon being ensured a life of warmth and plenty they could renounce that evil—\nI thought this child would have long since vanished everyone. But this time, I may well find hope for humanity.",

When a new shoot emerges, no one can predict whether it will become a meal for a starving beast or grow into a towering giant with branches reaching to the sky.\nSome individuals may be destined for greatness from birth, standing at the pinnacle of their cohort, but natural laws will eventually push all once tiny creations toward a greater destiny in the currents of time.\nWith enough patience, perhaps one day every sapling will grow into a being even more magnificent than the mightiest tree we can conceive of. Will that day come? Yes, it will. That's why they bear seeds and allow themselves to decay and return to the soil to nourish their offspring, rather than permanently hoarding all the nutrients they take in. This is not an act of pity, but an act of hope.\nNow, if we expand this context to the entire ecosystem, rather than confining ourselves to a specific species, what happens? All living things help each other, cultivate the land and the sea, making the entire planet more abundant and creating a better living environment for ourselves and future generations. Yes, the possibility of this outcome is equally present in every last ordinary seed.\n...\nThat's what the plan should have been, prior to certain unexpected events.",

Let's start by interviewing the operator standing right here. Hello, Mina, you must have heard of the 'hidden singer,' right?'\n'Uh... not really.'\n'It's been causing quite a buzz! The whole thing is so strange. For an entire week, the cafeteria speakers played a song at the same time every morning. But when fans of the song asked around, the broadcast room staff insisted that no one had played any music or sung in there!'\n'Ah, I've been up on the scaffold each morning this week, refinishing the wall, so I must've missed it. Shucks, what a shame.'\n'Then maybe you can help us, Mina. Based on the accent and lyrics, I'm pretty sure the voice belongs to a Colombian operator! She was singing: Onward! Onward! Dig! Dig! Build! Build! Our city must keep growing!'\n'The dust falls in our eyes, as the towers rise—wait, you got me singing along! Haha!'\n'Yes, exactly! That's how it goes! Wait, your voice sounds somewhat similar... but they sang with so much more energy!'\n'If you don't belt your heart out on the worksite, the foreman'll think you're slacking. But if you ask me who else know this song...'\n'—Yes, very suspicious indeed. Mina, you're used to singing at work, and it just so happens that every time this mysterious singing started, you were on the job? I think we'll need to check out your work area.'\nThe upper platform of Rhodes Island Cafeteria.\n'Hello, everyone! Are we any closer to the truth now? So, this is the wall Mina's been working on, right? Wait, what's this I found?!' 'That's my mobile powerbank. I always leave it in place till the job's done.'\n'I mean what's on top of it—look! It's a microphone!'\n'Oh, that old thing? It's just for fun. Look, you can see the beautiful nomadic city in the distance through the porthole; who wouldn't wanna sing before such a nice view? But my wireless speaker's broken, so no way the sound's making it downstairs.'\n'Hmm? Oh!'\nWith a sudden gasp, Click grabs the microphone. 'Ladies and gentlemen, we've solved the mystery! The hidden singer is—'\nMina looks at the microphone in confusion. It was supposed to connect to the wireless speaker in front of her, but instead—somehow she had connected it to an unfamiliar speaker labeled 'Cafeteria Hall.'\n'Ah... was it really me?'\nRemembering how she'd sung those corny lyrics, thinking no one could hear, Mina winces and covers her face.",

          "description": "The girl doesn't remember how long she was asleep. Her only thought is that the sunshine is too bright, and she hides beneath her blanket in defiance. But the wind blowing through the window brings with it a soothing lemon scent. Upon catching it, she stretches out her head and opens her eyes.\nShe sees fever medication and half a glass of water atop her bedstand, and her grandmother sitting beside her, alongside a few others anxiously staring at her. In a daze, she is propped up by her grandmother, while the others take turns checking the thermometer. Soon after, the air no longer feels so stuffy, and the room returns to its usual levity.\nHer grandmother tells her she had a fever, and that she slept for several days. The aroma of oat porridge stirs her appetite, and the brightly-colored cherry tomatoes dotting the bowl are pretty enough that one could hardly look away. Nonetheless, the subtle lemon fragrance entices her to gaze out the window. She sees clothes drying and waving in the wind, while the lemon trees in the garden send her their greetings. Just like every other windy morning.\nThe girl's head clears a bit more, yet she feels like some of her memories have gotten fuzzy.\nA few days later, she apprehensively asks her grandmother for help remembering, but she only comforts her, saying they were just fever dreams.\nHer grandmother hadn't put away her bubble wand, and she never emptied her bottle of soapy water. She had merely called a big gathering to discuss the family leaving Siracusa, and what they needed to prepare for their move to Columbia.\nBut that was no fever dream. It happened, and the girl had seen it with her own eyes.\nShe thinks of the bubbles she chased that day. Of her grandmother working on the street corner. Of how, despite being a rainless day, the streets were wet, with water slowly flowing towards the drains. Of how the mixture of reeking blood, smoke, and sweat attracted all sorts of bugs to its surface.\n...Many years later, that vivid scene still remains in her memory. Luckily, Aroma remembers what her grandmother often said:\n'Since you can't get rid of the horrible smells, best open up the window and let them all out!\n'In the end, only the fragrances that always follow us will be left.'\nIn the parcel sent by her grandmother, Aroma sees a glass bottle from her childhood. She removes the cork, dips her bubble wand into the soapy water, then slowly, gently, blows a bubble.\nShe smells it. It still is, and always will be, lemon-scented.",

          "description": "For the first time, she quarreled with her mother over a field mission.\nSeveral months ago, after one such mission, while mending her cloak, her mother suddenly asked if she could stop going on these missions. She tried to convince her mother that the missions were safe, but her mother was unusually stubborn. Advice turned into argument, and the argument festered like a dull thorn. Standing at the edge of a cliff with shouts behind her, all Zoey Perris could think of was her mother's anxious eyes when she left Rhodes Island.\nAs her pursuers closed in, Zoey leapt off the cliff. An arrow whizzed past her, and she suddenly realized that to her mother, frayed hems meant falls, holes implied an arrow had missed a vital spot, and tears suggested narrowly saved limbs.\nFor the first time, she made her daughter unhappy over a field mission.\nDespite Zoey explaining the safety of these missions many times, she couldn't shake those ominous dreams. She opened the door to find Zoey standing outside, with the tattered cloak covered in dust.\nSuddenly, regret washed over her. She was the patient to be cared for, and it was her daughter who managed everything perfectly. Life wasn't about Zoey easing her burdens anymore, but about her trying to ease Zoey's.\nShe let Zoey take off the cloak, admitting she'd been overthinking. But Zoey didn't respond. Instead, she pulled her mother to sit down and began explaining the damages on the cloak—branches, gravel, finbeasts... until she reached the rip made by an arrow.\nShe saw her mother gently shake her head, more pleading than forbidding. But she continued, recounting how an infected man, almost enslaved because no one would help him, led to the slaver firing that arrow out of spite.\n'Each mission, we actually helped some people, who were just a bit luckier than Dad, who didn't vanish silently. And the damage to the cloak isn't always from weapons. This time, it was just this one arrow... I can take care of myself. Please rest assured.'\nZoey bit her lip, looking at her mother, whose face showed a mix of sorrow and pride. Finally, her mother silently patted her head, took off her cloak, and draped the previously mended one over her shoulders.\nThe sewing machine hummed as Zoey, wrapped in the carefully patched cloak, tiptoed out of her mother's room, silently apologizing for calling a blade a fin.\nBehind her, the sewing machine paused for a moment—the instant her mother noticed the unnaturally smooth tear—then resumed its sad yet proud rhythm.",

          "description": "'Beanstalk, that sales contractor you were in touch with finally sent their first draft of the ad copy!' \n'Nice! Lemme have a look!'\nThank you for choosing the 'All-You-Crabs-Eat' smart metal crab feeder! This device uses cutting-edge smart technology to solve any issue you may run into while raising metal crabs. Racked with worry that you can't tend to your crabs while away from home? Afraid that ordinary feeders could incubate harmful bacteria that will affect your crabs? Well, worry no more! The 'All-You-Crabs-Eat' offers your crabs a nutritionally balanced diet, all pre-portioned according to the latest science!\n'Sounds good, but what's this 'cutting-edge smart technology'?'\n'Oh, I asked Mayer to help with the computer interface stuff. In return, I lent her Peacake to help her develop a biomimetic intelligent partner.'\n'I see...'\nIf you're using this device for the first time, please follow the illustrated instructions to assemble the feeder and food barrel, then use the touchscreen to complete your device's basic setup. The 'All-You-Crabs-Eat' offers three preset feeding schedules, and can support up to ten additional custom schedules. And if you can't bear to miss the wonder of even a single feeding session, order our camera now and enjoy a 20% discount!\n'A camera? Whose idea was that?'\n'I thought of it during training! The instructors stuck some tiny cameras on crabs for a while to assess their combat abilities. So I figured I'd add something similar as an upgrade for the feeder! Cute pet videos are all the rage on Columbia's intercity net, you know!'\nDue to their omnivorous nature, we suggest setting the feeder to a single daily serving, with a serving size not exceeding 10% of the weight of your metal crab. The 'All-You-Crabs-Eat' supports freeze-dried feed, and requires no pre-crushing. We recommend using it with 'Beanstalk's Fine Metal Crab Feed,' launching alongside the feeder! With fifteen natural ingredients following a carefully developed formula, your crabs will be feasting like kings! Their pincers will grow stronger!\nUsage instructions:\n1. Do not feed children with this device.\n2. Place the device on a level surface to avoid spillage.\n'P.S. While setting up your feeding schedule, please remove your metal crab from the room. Some breeds are extremely intelligent, and may learn to use the feeder.'\n'I-Is that really true?'\n'Of course. That's how Peacake did. And if I'm not careful, she'll invite all her buddies over for a buffet.'",

          "description": "When he left Lien’s, it had been raining for several days and nights in Kou-wu City. The fallen sycamore leaves densely covered the ground, burying the smell of fish beneath the soil. He bolted the gate of the kung fu hall from the inside, and in the dead of night, took a copper rod from the weapon rack used for emergencies, climbed the wall, and left the courtyard. \nNot long afterwards, a town near Kou-wu City found itself one sunglass-sporting fortune-teller extra. On sunny days, he would set up his stall at intersections, and on rainy days with few pedestrians, he would take his umbrella and go fishing by the river outside town. The umbrella perfectly covered him, its ribs heavy so it would not blow away. Some envied him for living such a flamboyant lifestyle - was he so attuned to Heaven's will that he could keep his head up above the ocean of mundane affairs? Others accused him of being a cheat and a fraud, questioning if he really knew his own destiny. \n'Of course. How could I not know?' He would reply with a smile. \nAn umbrella only protects one from the rain, but not against concealed weapons like arrows or darts. His umbrella torn, he has no choice but to pack his bags and find another town where he could mend his umbrella. Numerous are the days of dark wind and rain, and he gradually feels that he had nowhere to go. All he knows is that the endpoint of his life will still be at that martial arts hall. He needs not walk the path that follows afterwards, but he knows not how to traverse the path leading there. The inch of ground beneath his umbrella is hardly enough for him to settle down, for it is no solid roof. \nBut it is then that he meets a strange group of people. Later, he learns another saying from those people. If translated into mandarin Yanese, it would be 'Heaven's mandate lies in man.' \n––The above is what Operator Mr. Nothing told you personally. Rhodes Island is currently running from a small-scale Catastrophe in the making at full speed, but Mr. Nothing is lying on a chair without a worry in the world, his umbrella tied and tucked away at his side. Through the porthole, you can see the sun behind the Originium rain. \n'The sky clears after the rain passes. The Heavens have eyes, and gaze down upon us. Say, Doctor, would you care for a pair of sunglasses?'",

The toughest battle he ever endured... was just a match in a Kazimierz arena.\nIs he really qualified for this job?\nWhy would a Columbian recruit a group of warriors from all across the world?\nJust as these thoughts run through his mind, someone pushes open the door.\nA tall, red-haired lady wearing sunglasses walks in.\nShe has a small gun hanging from her waist, but she is not a Sankta.\nShe walks up to the podium, clearly in no hurry.\n\n'Welcome to my squad.'\n'You can call me Ash.'",

Are you talking about County York? That's a city in Victoria.'\n'In other words, Victoria has a County York, but Columbia doesn’t have a New York??'\n'That's right.'\n\nThe soldier falls silent again, muttering something along the lines of 'this makes no sense.'\nThumbtack recalls an incident last week at the cafeteria, when Ash was shocked to see blue tomatoes and square potatoes.\nMost of the operators were visibly perplexed.\nJust what kind of country do they come from?\n\n'Now that I think about it...'\nThumbtack decides to change the topic.\n'When we get a day off this week, the folks from Engineering are going to play football on the deck. Want to watch?'\n'Football... what exactly is that?'\n'Have you never seen a football game before? 11 players on each side, and they try to kick a ball into the other team’s goal.'\n'Oh! Yeah, I know that one.'\nFor a moment, the expression on Ash’s face becomes much softer.\n\nThat's something comforting to her?\nThumbtack remains at a loss.\n",

That there's a land in the wastes for these refugees to eke out a living?'\nThe mercenaries' worries weren't without reason, Kötz understands that.\nBut he has no grounds to doubt that young Leithanian noble. The self-professed Hyacinth Count's Arts have saved countless people in the midst of war, and he claims he can lead these people to a new home.\nSuch kindness is hard to come by.\nKötz turns to look back at the procession of refugees.\nLeithanians, Siracusans, and those driven from their homelands by conflict, now exiles of the wastes.\nThe despairing crowd trudges slow on the barren ground. Their destination, a land that exists only in legend.\n\nAnd far in the distance, a colossal glut of buildings appears on the horizon before them.\nWhen the procession reaches its destination, the people let out a collective sigh at the sight.\nAmidst a swathe of ruins, a number of constructs tower, goliaths near a hundred meters each, their sensational metal structures sheltering from the setting sun.\nYet Kötz lapses into silence.\nThe lofty metal monoliths strike no sense of wonder in him. In his own world, such buildings stood on every corner. Only their dimensions speak to a difference.\nThe colossal parabola of the antenna dish is riddled with holes, its pedestal imposing firm and straight in its root upon the earth. The wastes' bitter winds bore through those holes, giving rise to a terrifying whistle.\nUnder these ancient buildings, the low mumble of machinery still sounds, the impression cast that some equipment remains at work.\nThis radio telescope of such preposterous size is clearly not of this age.\n'So this is that land where the titans sound...'\n'Do you see that big bowl that's fallen over there?'\nThe Hyacinth Count points far off at another telescope, collapsed in disrepair.\nIts parabolic antenna, size encapsulated in tens of meters, lays turned over on the ground, forming a sturdy shelter.\n'Quite a number could fit in there.'\n'There's a spring nearby, and according to recent records, there's been very few Catastrophes in the area.'\n'So, why has nobody settled down here?'\n'Because they fear this place.'\nWith a discontented chuckle, the young Count explains.\n'Sargonians think these buildings are the remnants of a long-gone disaster.'\n'Minoans believe this place is cursed.'\n'But as a scientist, I have no faith in any of this unfounded hearsay.'\nThe refugees turn through the building's remains, finding in the age-old ruins a place of respite.\nThis is to be their new home.\n\nNight falls and Kötz sits alone, high on the ancient building, gazing at the complex, each part of it just as foregone.\nWhat went into the making of these vestiges, such that they persist from innumerable years to this very day?\nThe people of this world once looked with hope to the starry skies, but what was it that happened afterward?\nHe looks across the wastes stretching from near to far.\nEven further off, the twin moons gently rise.\n",

It would be enough where we're from.'\n'If your leg gets caught in it, it usually takes some work to break out.'\nFrost adjusts her 'Welcome Mat' as she explains to the Engineering operator how the trap works.\n'But just this little force definitely doesn't have enough bite to it.'\n'Forget Arts. With this little strength, most Terran could break free without much effort. Even I could.'\n'Look at the equipment you're using, though. It's so advanced. Like your comms. It's amazing! You don't need any Originium to power it, and it's tiny!'\nThe Engineering operator prods Tina's communications equipment with fascination.\n'Especially this solar panel! How did you make it so small? I never saw technology like this back in Columbia. It's amazing.'\n'Anyway, it might take some time to modify the equipment. You can come check on us if that sounds like your thing.'\n'Oh, right. I need a hunting bow. Can I apply for that here?'\n'A hunting bow?'\nA few hours later, the Engineering operator finds herself even more perplexed when Tina tries her best to draw a Sarkaz military-grade bowstring.\nTheir military prowess and combat techniques are extremely professional, and their equipment and tactics are beyond cutting-edge, but their physical qualities are comparatively lacking. Where are they from?\nIs it because their physiques are so imperfect that they have to make up for it with technology?\nOut of respect for everyone involved, however, the Engineering operator decides against pressing further, instead opting to keep her questions to herself.",

Say, what point does she have giving us all one of these... works recorder thingym'bobs?'\n'You think I'd have a clue? Yours's been on the whole time. See how you lost it in the first place, maybe?'\n'Sure.'\n\n[Display View] Before clocking out, a worker tosses the recorder aside as he changes.\n'Hahah, my arse someone took it. You lost it your own silly self.'\n'Shtum.'\n\n[Display View] Not long after the worker leaves, Shana suddenly appears in the workplace.\n'Wait, that's the boss, nah?'\n\n[Display View] Shana checks over the equipment for wear and tear, tweaking any gummed-up specimens one by one. She stops before a drilling rig, and fishes out a notebook to write in.\n'Y'know, it stumped me how our machines worked like such a charm without our tiny team having any maintenance people. S'pose the boss did all the work.'\n'That's the Brooks' driller. Definitely had a bit of dullness digging up the rock the day before. They just kept on using it, but I guess the boss noticed straight away.'\n'All our drills are her upgrades, after all. Better than anyone else's. She's the master here.'\n\n[Display View] Shana moves onto inspecting the recent construction. At a part that's been finished, she ponders for a moment before bringing out her recorder and beginning to examine.\n'I know what happened there. Gallen was wanting to give his family a call and rushed to finish. I thought something was off myself. Just was too busy with my own work to take a proper look in time.'\n'Shh—listen to what she's saying. 'Concrete is 3cm too thin.' That would've been a hazard lurking. So she susses out the recorders to catch stuff like this.'\n\n[Display View] Shana nonchalantly tears open a packet of mints, one of which accidentally falls onto the ground. She picks it up, blows off the dust, then pops it in her mouth like nothing happened.\n'*sigh* Funny how she's always so breezy. Guess once she's down in the mines... she'd be like any of us.'\n'Only met one other foreman as good as her in all my working life.'\n'You did?'\n'Yeah, middle-aged bloke. Didn't discriminate against us Infected, always brought his daughter to the site to eat with the crew. I would've gladly worked with him until retirement, but then one time a project he was on caught him. A potential safety hazard became an accident. Had to disband the whole construction crew after that.'\n'Shame.'\n'Been over ten years now, but I think I still vaguely remember his name. Was it... Moleman?'\n'...Y'know, our boss's full name is—Shana Moleman.'",

          "description": "Ieddne and Áhttje pull up young Qanipalaat by the hands, and walk through the snow that barely reaches to the knees.\nMeasuring the tundra's breadth by their own two feet is a tradition of the sijdda's rescue team, handed down unchanged for several generations. It has been written into story, woven into folksong, taught by parents to their children while they still burble and babble, climb to their feet with a stagger, learning all the while.\nThere is a symbol that a child of the sijdda is young no longer, has become an adult who will weather the blizzards, and it is not by means of counting years, but by whether they can enter the tundra alone, and retrieve a knot of blessings that their parents tied to a pillar of ice in the snowy fields at their birth. His viellja and oabbá told him countless times, half in flaunting and half in earnestness, of being out there and what they saw, and it made young Qanipalaat look forward to it like nothing else.\nThe pillar, limpid crystal in its glimmer, stands upright and alone. Too wide for even ten to encircle, this frozen colossus shines in a pale blue. They drew the way they'd come on the bark of a massive tree upon the tundra, a tree that would stretch its branches further day by day, reaching for somewhere unknown.\nWhen he said with all the grand aspiration in his heart that he'd join the rescue team when he grew up, his áhttje gave him a miniature hiking cane carved of wood. All about did he run in excitement, and confidently tripped straight over in the snow. Lifting his head up to look, his áhttje laughed as he pulled him to his feet, and the stars in the sky shone with a flicker, snowflakes perching on his nose.\n\nAlone, he walks through the snow that barely reaches to the knees.\nHe's arrived at a place further than his viellja or áhttje have ever been, but he knows that's because the tundra is where his áhttje's life ultimately lingers, and his brother can no longer take on any assignments with his injured leg. The other members worry for Qanipalaat's young age, but he always stands at the very front.\nHe takes note of the peculiar phenomena, and when he returns, he describes them with care to those in his sijdda that compose folksong; in return for his lifesaving grace, the Columbian doctor accompanying him stays with the sijdda, and actively helps by examining people's ailments; Qanipalaat lies over the elder's lap and sweetly persuades, so the Liberi woman who often comes to see her mother may begin to converse with their most stubborn elder who nevertheless has witnessed the most of all, and in return she can share her newest discoveries.\nHe departs from his sijdda, and then returns bringing even more things. He runs on trip after trip, until finally, he falls straight to the ground as weariness takes its physical toll. And when those around him move to help him back up, worried, Qanipalaat wipes his face off and lies there on the ground, staring up at the snowflakes falling down from the sky.\n'If a blizzard blows past the tip of my nose, that's my áhttje come to see me.'\nAnd his áhttje's snowflake floats down.",

          "description": "When Indigo was still newly arrived on Rhodes Island, we conducted a study on her staff. The unit at its head seemed to be the key to its function, but we could find no clear theory underpinning it. During further studies, new Operators Irene and Lumen—who had visited Engineering to undergo equipment certification—coincidentally passed by, and the latter took one look at Indigo's staff and very confidently told us that he had seen something similar in the 'Eye of Iberia.' The 'Eye of Iberia' is a lighthouse... a series of lighthouses along Iberia's coastal towns, a grand project that once illuminated the whole nation, abandoned altogether after a disaster decades ago, and now a legacy of the age. Indigo's teacher was one of those very lighthouse keepers, and it was he who gave her the staff as she left home.\n'The unit at her staff's head is a standard installation in Iberia's lighthouse systems.' This much should be more or less accurate. The issue was that, based on her account, her teacher protected the Rocky Coast's lighthouse all his life, hoping it would one day shine anew. So why would he give her something so important and then allow her to leave?\nIndigo herself had this to say: 'I'm sure my teacher wanted me to gain some experience on the outside, unravel the secret of its technology, and let it come to life once again... He really was mindful!'\nMeanwhile, Irene stated: 'Will Iberia's lighthouses never shine again without those Ægir relics? Iberia's prosperity should be left up to the Iberians themselves this time.'\nIndigo and Irene's answers undoubtedly represent two different outlooks held by the modern Iberian on the nation's future, and deserve some consideration. However, once they had both left, Lumen raised an alternative, 'small-minded' conjecture, more or less that before an old man sends his granddaughter off to the city, he stuffs the only valuable they own into her suitcase and hopes she'll never come back, or that he'll have passed by the time she does... or thereabouts.\n'The elderly are like that. They like to decide everything for you while you're still clueless,' Lumen added.\nSpeculating on an old man's intentions seemed unnecessary. Besides, having ascertained the history of her Arts unit, our investigation into Indigo was complete. And, of course, it would never have affected how welcome she is at Rhodes Island. But we will note that upon learning the staff's origins, Indigo went blank for a moment. As for what thoughts she had in that instant, and what decisions she made, we have no way of knowing.",

Three hours? Five? The golden sands rush through my clothes, tempest throwing the dust against my face, without reprieve, so rough against my eyes I have to keep them shut. But we can't stop yet—the Sarkaz mercenaries behind us are still fast on our tail—they're trained and tireless—even a sandstorm couldn't hold their march back. \nAnd the water... might have been drunk dry long ago. \nI've heard traditions that in the desert, filling empty canteens with sand can give people hope, but right now, I've drunk enough sand. Water—I just want one gulp of water. Even if it costs every coin of mine in exchange, I would do it. \nBut in these wilds, the shine of metal has no meaning at all. \nClutching this silver case tight, I grit my teeth and keep striding. \nMy ears are battered with mournful screams. Like the deceased are howling, and ghosts are calling. Maybe Professor Thorne is among them, calling my name? \nBut I can't quite make it out. \nHow long has my brain spent filled with these noises now? Three minutes? Three hours? Or three years? \nThe dust has blocked the sky out, day and night all the same now, time practically stood still, and only the people seeking to survive through all this still endure through this welter of punishment. \nI just wanted to research, I just wanted to offer my strength to the furtherment of science. I didn't want this—desiccating away in this sea of sands—not like this. \nMy head aches and swells and stings, my body seemingly gone long without any sense. Am I walking, or am I watching this body named Elliot squirm? \nNo... thinking too has become too much to ask. Only one thing wanders in my head, a single order: move. \nMove... move... move... \n...but the desert is limitless. \n'Elliot, open your mouth.' \nOpen my mouth? \nI subconsciously slacken my muscles, let my lips and teeth reveal the channel to my oral cavity. \nA fruit coated in sand and soil lands in my mouth. \nAcrid? And sweet? Oh, it's water. It's water. \nIt's water. \n...... \nSince when, I don't know, but there's no more wind at my ears, the land has returned to peace, and there's only sun, sand, and two earthly humans walking through the dunes. \n...... \nI gaze off far. Beyond the yellow dust, is still more yellow dust. \nNo end is in sight, just like technical documentation scattered all across the ground to be trodden by wet leather shoes, no longer able to be reassembled, nor made sense of. \nIn anger, I kick at the sand, and watch it tumble and slide down the dune, then blend again into the desert, as if nothing ever happened. \nSand, sand. \nI begin to hate sand for the first time in my entire life. \n'Let's go. We'll be able to replenish supplies very soon.' \nKal'tsit interrupts my train of thought. \nUm, very soon? How soon can it be? \nAnd resupply? How much could that be? \nBut—Kal'tsit never promises hope to anyone. \nBut at least... \nI think I can see a cactus.",

          "description": "The Reefsteep Black Market, where I was born anew.\nAt the end of the western passage, one can see the land and the sky. Once, it was an arms dealer's territory. I worked under him in my first few years in this place. He was a born despot. He left several welts on my back, but I've no hate for him. It was only natural, just as it was only natural that his irate underlings slit his throat in drunkenness, before throwing him from a cliff. I placed my first gold coin in those turncoats' hands, and it was warm to the touch.\nThe northern oasis, Reefsteep's border. For a time and an age, the favored turf of the mercenaries. Soldiers were replaced batch by batch, but there was only ever one leader. My biggest customer, and the one who taught me how to taste wine. But that winter, he died. He died in front of my storehouse, his body bruised and battered. He coveted my creations, and died to my precautions. Mercenaries keep no loyalty, and thus I rewarded his subordinates at his funeral. Unfortunately, his life couldn't even buy a decent bottle of wine.\nThe southern side, where the towns sit. Messengers and merchants come and go in spades, the value they trade in circulating through the villages. The lords recognize as much, hence why Ibut's lord ameer had such a special fondness for the place. Sargon's unbearably chaotic, barbaric politics never interested me, but I needed the lord's support. The division of powers within the Reefsteep Black Market bored me so much I'm loathe to mention it, but we all had something to say when it came to the lord. I'm surprised that I held such frail relations for so long; a lord that doesn't judge by the cover, perhaps? Out of respect, I didn't personally attend the revolt. But once his family were puppets, I did show up to pay respects to that poor boy—he was akin to Elliot. Akin to me.\nThe Reefsteep Black Market's center. An old tomb lies there, an ancient pasha's grave. Every night, Isin carefully wipes his memory under the light of the stars. A long time ago, I exhausted his wealth. And by now, I've repaid him several times over, but he doesn't pay any mind. His age looms by the day, and aside from a few errant, insignificant questions, we never even speak.\nThat day, Old Isin asked me why others call me 'Sand Soldier.'\n'Sand Soldier.'\nThe meaninglessness of a grain of sand. The pathetic fate of a pawn. The term is filled with significance I abhor.\nHence why I gladly accepted it. As a price paid in advance, for the impossible trial to follow. The Reefsteep Black Market had its towns, and they were fuel ready for the fire.\nI waited for the lord ameer of Ibut to come. If I could, I would have burned even the golden sands to nothing.\nAnd in the final moment before I set the flame alight—\n—what came to mind was the afternoon a young Elliot Glover was taken to tour an institute of science, where he sees a new model of Originium engine ignite and combust, upon which a tremendous machine stirs to life. He's always remembered how much that moved him.\nI've always remembered.",

          "description": "Ning-Ning,\nHave you been eating and sleeping well lately? In your last letter, you mentioned often waking up startled at night, which has made us very worried. Your second sister has been transferred to work in Danyan, and she went up the mountain there and picked some nerve-soothing herbs for you. She plans to send them to you via a Messenger—has your address changed recently? If it has, please write back soon to let us know your new address. Or maybe she can ask the Chun-qian team to contact Rhodes Island's office and give the herbs to them. Which way works better for you?\nAs for what you asked about in your last letter, your dad has already looked into it for you. Thankfully no one was hurt in the snowstorm last month. Your dad carried the disaster-prevention pamphlets you sent back and handed them out door-to-door. The teachers at the local school read those pamphlets and even praised your writing, saying your wrist strength has greatly improved. When he told me this, I felt really happy for you, but when the night falls, I still can't help but feel a bit sad. Ning-Ning, my girl, you're far from home now. When you sit at the desk writing and studying until your fingers are all sore, you wouldn't be able to run over to me for a good massage... All I can do is remind you to rest well in my letters. You've always been a smart child, and now you've even learned much about saving lives. I'm sure you know better how to take good care of yourself, right?\nOh, I have a funny story to share with you. The festival is coming up next week, and not only are the kids excited about the rice dumplings and snacks, even Grandma is thrilled. When the weather is nice, she likes to do some needlework on her lounge chair, but her eyesight isn't great, so she always needs help threading the needle. One afternoon, when I got back home from work, she complained to me that she had called for you many times in the morning, but you never came. I didn't know how to explain it to her; it was both funny and a bit sad. I took the afternoon off that day and made two sachets with Grandma. Actually, I've never really sewed anything before, so my stitching came out all crooked—you'll probably recognize which one I made at first glance. Or you can tell it by its smell. I filled it with some dried acanthopanax root, the same herb we used to put under your pillow to help calm your mind. Hang the sachet by your bed and it should give off a gentle scent that might help you sleep better.\nYour dad and I agreed to cooperate on this letter and it was supposed to start with me writing and then your dad finishing it. But he sat there chewing on the end of his pen half the night without writing a single word. With the Messenger arriving at dawn, I decided to just finish it myself. Everything at home is going well, and both your dad and I are doing fine at work. Whenever people talk about you, they always praise how strong and brave you are. Your father and I have read your last letter over and over again.\nIf you have the time, maybe send another letter home?",

          "description": "Upon hearing her mother leave the house, young Gladiia gets up from her bed, calls her lamp alight, and pulls out her vanity handmirror from under her pillow. Not that she would with any regularity be fully awake when the clock rolls over to zero, but tonight, she needs to look at herself. She needs to choose. As other Ægir view her, she is Gladiia, daughter of key Academy of Sciences personnel, winner of all youth competitions, a family girl, a young success story. But in her mirror, Gladiia sees a carbon-based robot, an emotionless form. Her memory begins with her birth mother being infatuated with Ægir affairs and Academy policymaking, her home merely a secondary point of residence, after the Academy's lounge. She once believed her birth mother sought accomplishment from her, and so she compelled herself to relentlessly reach new heights, applying the standards of adults to her young self. But she never was able to pry any form of feedback from her birth mother—no acknowledgement, no criticism, nothing whatsoever. No, her birth mother gave all her time to Ægir, and left not one idle second of one spare minute for her daughter.\nPerhaps it was all an accident that she was raised, and this household had no reason to exist. This was the sort of conclusion Gladiia reached.\nSo, what else but to look for somewhere she can truly call 'home,' Ægir she can truly call 'family.'\nShe has decided. She will seek. She is set to do it.\nShe wants to hear for herself just what kind of case her birth mother might make in a civil court of law.\nGladiia stows away the handmirror, turns off her light, and sinks into rest.\nHer mind swims frantically with planning.\nShe is restless all night.\n......\nGladiia stands before the tremendous standing mirror of the Consul's residence, examining her negligible self in the looking glass. In just a few hours, she will depart the mansion, take to an operating table, and begin the Abyssal Hunter modification surgery. Perhaps, the moment the procedure is over, her dutiful vocation will be as a military commander and not a Technology Consul, and she will take to the battlefield, there becoming a monster with hands drenched in fresh blood. This has completely destroyed any notion of plotting her life's trajectory, and may even end her time then and there. Gladiia has never feared death, nor the giving of her life, but the sumptuous hall she sees in the mirror does make clear to her an aside—she is still teeming with regrets. Some are desires, some are responsibilities, some are promises, and becoming an Abyssal Hunter will render them all forever unfulfilled. If only the surgery could be postponed long enough, if only Ægir could publish the full scope of the plans to her as soon as possible... This is the first time she realizes that she had never had it all firmly in her grasp like she thought. She will lose, and she will never be able to regain.\nGladiia looks around the hall one more time, then returns to her study.\nIn a few hours, she will depart for the Abyssal Hunter experimentation site. Before she does, she has the mansion's smart housekeeping system store two documents.\nOne, her speech to be given upon becoming an Abyssal Hunter.\nOne, a will.\n......\nAfter Gladiia is marooned in a land not of Ægir, she has in the truest sense of the words lost it all. All she has left with her are a bloodridden lance, a still-passable outfit, and a desiccated and scorching eternity. And now, she stands before a pothole filled with fresh water, gazing upon her own reflection, washing the filth and bloodstains from her clothes.\nThe silt comes off with the water easily enough, but the clots of blood on her garments refuse to be washed off. With no option but to brush them by hand, she watches as their hardened forms attain a pellucidity, turn the shade of liquid blood, and run through the seams, dripping to a rest upon the soil. Is it her blood? The Seaborn's blood? Or her fellows' blood? She cannot differentiate. All of a sudden, Gladiia notices something, and she leans close to the hole, carefully examining her neck.\nA tiny scale.\nThough why is a mystery, Gladiia's birth mother comes to her mind in that moment. If she could, she would rather suffer her neglect again. This scale would never have found the chance to rest upon her neck.\nBut it has.\nGladiia stands up, and throws her freshwater-soaked hair behind her in one gesture.\nShe can indeed feel it. There is an embitterment, a discontent inside her. There is no need for these feelings to surface, and they do nothing to help in this present situation.\nShe has indeed lost it all, but she finds she can still afford to uphold her basic honor and dignity, which in turn means she can still move onwards with her head held high.\nShe needs no hope. She simply focuses on possibilities, feasibilities, and results.\nShe can still return to Ægir.\nShe is still alive to recover the Abyssal Hunters, scattered and lost.\nAs long as the probability is not zero, she is still bound to try.\nSo make good on it she shall.\nGladiia wipes her lance's bloodstains dry, and vanishes from the side of the 'hole.'\nSeconds later, the sonic boom jolts the water from the pool, blanketing any and all trace she was ever there.",

          "description": "'Technology Consul Gladiia, before we proceed with the surgery, I am authorized to ask: Would you like to keep a sample of your original genes?'\nLittle Handy nimbly extends its mechanical arm, and through its speaker comes the voice of the researcher in charge of the surgery.\nThe Consul looks up at the faces of the Ægir in the remote operation room. Many of these researchers are elites she hand-picked from the Academy of Technology—capable, experienced, and loyal to both the Ægir people and every dome under the tides. Now, these elites look back at their Consul through the mirror, made from the same material as the domes, and purse their lips. Since asking her the question, none have spoken; some even turn away from the gaze of their Consul.\nAs a Consul, social rationality is usually the only philosophical instrument Gladiia needs to analyze the behaviors of others. Born in the sea, the Ægir never display meaningless behavior, so at this moment, she is particularly curious about the silence of her fellow people. Is it reverence, fear, or sadness? Or perhaps it is guilt and relief all at once, that the person who has to sacrifice their body to merge with the Sea Born and save all of Ægir is not them?\nShe knows she will not get the answer now, and will have no need for it once the surgery is complete.\nShe remembers when the Academy of Science attempted to develop a batch of artificial organisms injected with Sea Born neuro-cells. These organisms were intended to mimic Sea Born activities in a controlled environment, aiding the Ægir in understanding those abominations. To achieve this, they had to be both loyal servants of the Ægir and establish a limited connection with the Sea Born and their clan.\nShe recalls that the project, which initially made huge progress, ended in tragedy. As cell integration reached a critical point, the organisms were quickly assimilated by the Sea Born and devoured the entire research team. The Sea Patrol had no choice but to call off the rescue and obliterate the entire research facility from the sea bed with their battleship.\nShe also remembers her mother, Horatia, being a staunch supporter of that radical project. They had even debated over it. Now, Gladiia herself is about to partake in an even more radical experiment, with several failed attempts and dead subjects before her already.\nThe first Hunter of Ægir once said that the Abyssal Hunters would not repeat the failure of the artificial organisms because they are not slaves, but warriors who command the tides.\nThe abyss may claim my body, but I still belong to Ægir.\n'Scissors.' The Consul's order is curt. Little Handy extends its other limb, and thin blades protrude from its end.\nShe holds out a lock of light golden hair and lets the blades close around it. When the surgery is complete, the blood of the Sea Born will change the color of her hair.\n'Store this for me. I will claim it back after the surgery.'",

Akafuyu doesn't turn around, but simply removes a shoulder guard with one hand and tosses it to Kirara. Her eyesight may be poor, but she's so aware of her surroundings, she might as well have a camera in her back.\n'This armor...'\n'It's an heirloom. It's not valuable. My master doesn't go out to fight much, so it was bequeathed to me.'\n'Um, the design...'\n'It's a very special shape to the armor. In the old days, each family had its own style.'\nKirara touches the shoulder guard and compares it to the armor in her game. She starts to think the developers must know of Akafuyu.\n'Someone asked me almost the same question before, a little girl about your age. She would ask me under her breath, 'Captain, is your armor made of some high-tech material? Can it really withstand a grenade blast?' Ha, she might have thought I was some antique.'\n'So, can it?'\n'Don't be a fool. It's hard, sure, but it's just a piece of metal. You'd do better training hard and listening to your commander. She knew that, of course. Still, this armor has saved me plenty of times. Look, the pit that jumps right out at you there, that crossbow bolt almost pierced clean through my arm. Oh, and she was there in the last battle, standing next to me. Damned near died.'\nKirara suddenly loses interest in the topic.\nThe heavy feeling on her knees reminds her that this shoulder guard is supposed to be unique, representing an era of glory passed from one generation to the next, still thick with the stench of war and sacrifice.\nBut now, it's a rare item in a popular game, and any player can get it, if they pay enough.\nAkafuyu stands up. Kirara decides to hurry over and take out the freshly purchased game disc before Akafuyu notices.\n'By the way, do you have a minute?' Akafuyu walks towards her, 'I just killed the final boss without taking any damage. Can you upload the recording to that forum you like? Oh, and put my name on it, so you-know-who doesn't miss it...'\nKirara only now notices the game on the screen. The main character is holding a wooden sword with the lowest ATK, wearing almost no armor, except... the piece currently resting on her knees.\n'Does it... bother you?'\n'What? Oh, that it's my armor? If someday the people of Higashi know it from a game, rather then from a battlefield... then it can only mean that the war is finally over.' Akafuyu takes back the shoulder guard and slots it neatly into place, 'I've waited too long for that day.'",

          "description": "The long-snouted slumberfoot is suffering from insomnia tonight. And she suffers alongside it.\nShe's never learned any biology, so she has no idea that insomnia is fatal for slumberfeet. If they cannot stick to their daily sixteen-hour sleep cycle, they will soon die from nervous disorders and organ failure.\nBut she is a hunter. She needs only see the tracks atop the sandy soil to understand thatthe slumberfoot cubs have lost their parents. Claw marks and bloodstains stretch from the torn-apart den to the surface, shells chafe against the undergrowth, and a set of footsteps gradually fades into the distance. It was the sandbeasts. They had a slight head-start on her and got to their prey before leaving.\nShe would rather not return empty-handed.\nShe takes a short knife from her boot, and walks towards the softly whimpering cubs, treading as quietly as she can. Her foster parents had drilled this bit of wisdom into her: everything that's managed to last in the wastes has some value. In her hands, these dying cubs would make excellent bait, whether to lure other preys into a trap, or to distract dangerous predators.\nThe stars are still bright in the sky, and the first light of dawn has yet to touch the horizon. The hunter returns to camp as she said she would, and blows a whistle. Children barely younger than her help take her crossbow bolts and snares, gleefully relieving her of her catch. They sharpen their skinning knives and cleaving axes as the rest of this small camp in the wilderness begins to swarm with activity. Furs and organs soon come together in a stream of visceral vapor that is rather hard to describe, rising up above the campfire.\nAfter a cup of hot, calming tea, the hunter returns to her tent. She feels about in front of her, then cautiously holds the warm slumberfoot cub's body. It no longer whimpers as it sleeps soundly in her arms, marked with perfectly straight black and white stripes between its eyes. This was the only surviving cub. It is strong, brave, and can secrete more of its hypnotic substance than its siblings could. The hunter knows that she and the children of the camp are far from the fairy tales of the nomadic cities, and a wanderer needs a reliable partner, not a tame and docile pet.\nShe takes out a small piece of felt and lets the cub sleep atop it, then forces her sore fingers to continue with her needlework. By the light of the campfire and the stars, she wants to make this little sleepyhead a hat before sunrise...\nRight, I'll call it 'Helmet' from now on.",

If you want to unlock them all and unlock the secret achievement, get trading with players!\n\n■ Competition Phase\nDon't forget, your ultimate goal is victory in the Survivals!\nMerry cooperation goes hand-in-hand with the struggle to compete afterwards! Use your survival skills to contest and loot other players' resources. Out in the wild, you can also lie in ambush, or directly challenge people, initiating one-on-one battles with other players!\nThe higher a player's survival rank, the bigger the advantage in the fight!

What flavor do you want?'\nThe girl tilts her head and thinks for a bit, then gives a confident reply. 'Chocolate! I want chocolate.'\n'It's New Year's today—I'll buy you two scoops. You can pick another flavor too.'\n'Chocolate. I want chocolate for both.'\n'Brilliant. Your wish is my command, my little pea.'\n'You're the best, Da!'\n'Don't run anywhere, now.'\nShe watches her father squeeze through the crowded park and disappear into the throng. When he does, she pulls her gaze away, and begins to stare at her feet and count. Count until her father comes back.\n'One, two, three...'\nThe powerful beating of a drum interrupts the girl's mumbling. She looks up and sees the little theater across from her pull its curtains wide open, its host gaily thumping away at a hand drum.\n'One, two, three! Ding-ding-ding, it's time for the puppet show! Gather around, little mateys, you won't want to miss this! Today we've got the Song of the Shepherd Boy.'\nDrawn by the adorable puppets, the girl can't help but approach the stage—though perhaps a wide-open wooden box would be a better description.\n'Come January, King took up his greatest cane, come February, General waved saber just the same,\n'Come March, riverbank burned with hardy flame, come April not a meadow to a sprout could claim,\n'Come May, shepherd hugged his hornbeasts tame, and swore they'd find new home, far away...'\nThe puppet hugs its shaggy hornbeast, seeming hurt beyond measure, and the girl can't help but grip tight at the cloth of her skirt. Behind the stage, the host continues to sing the song.\n'Come August he forded through rapids clear, and 'hind him brayed his herd so dear,\n'Unto drear September awaited forest grim, and shaking hornbeasts shook heads at him,\n'Unto high October, a rest at mountain's foot, his beasts flock'd 'round him at center put,\n'Unto cool November...'\nBefore the host sings the next line, a large hand drags the girl out of the audience.\n'Janie! Janie! What are you over here for? Why didn't you wait where I told you to?'\n'I... I saw there was a puppet show. It was really good.\n'Do you know, I came back to an empty bench and was scared half to death.'\n'I'm sorry, Da, I... I shouldn't have gone off.'\n'Come on, now. We'd better get home.'\n'I want to watch it more, Da, at least...' The rest of her sentence is gulped back down. She glances at the puppet and his hornbeast hugging each other tightly on stage, and the backdrop is a verdant spring. She lets out a sigh of relief, and leads her father by the hand.\n'Come on, Da, let's go home too.'\n'Ahah, shepherd boy found his hornbeast a new home, then. Yet another happily ever after. Here, your ice cream.'\n'Thank you.' The girl licks at her double scoop. 'Is it bad that it's happily ever after, Da?'\n'Not particularly, Janie, there's just a lot of them. Might say we're sick of it.'\n'Really? But even if they show them over and over, I think there's not a lot of happy endings anyway...' She takes another lick.",

I should never have called the number on that poster, should never have believed you. 'Wrankwood's Future Number One Makeup Artist' my ass, you're renting out a basement for a studio. Does Wrankwood even mean anything to you?\nI know, you don't have to tell me, I'm past my prime as an actor. But I just need to turn things around. I'm done being cast as the mayor's bodyguard just to get shot in the head. Done with being the cop they kill off in a shootout. Why else would I even come to you?!\nAt least I've still got my bottom line as a performer.\nWhat bottom line? A perfect face, that's what my bottom line is! Everyone wants to see a perfect face! In Wrankwood, they'll keep both our wallets stuffed as long as you can faithfully show off my good looks! Simple, right?\nBut what did you do?\nThe first time, I asked you to make me a heroic and honest young laborer, and you turned me into a miner who'd just crawled out of a pit.\nSecond time, I wanted be a Pioneer leader, but you dumped half a bag of sand over my head and covered me in sticky-ass paint. Security at the shoot thought I was a tramp and almost escorted me out!\nAnd then you started lecturing me on how creators have their own artistic pursuits, and the need to have fidelity to reality, and how fine work always shines.\nSure! I'll give you that, I was a dumbass who went and believed your crazy talk again, which is why I let you stick that freakish machine on my face again!\nI emphasized that this was a horror movie, and you promised you'd give me the scariest look of all. And what did you give me? Plasma smears? Leaking ulcers? Fangs? Not a single element to catch the eye, but a hell of a lot of causes for concern!\nAnd worst of all, I spend just a single moment by a heater, and the cameraman yells my face is melting once they start rolling! I give it a wipe and there's fake teeth and glass eyeballs falling off, all of it! FALLING OFF!\nIf the producer didn't see how much my role cost, he would've kicked me straight off the goddamn set!\nSo, you understand? I'm not coming to you anymore. You can rent your goddamn basement for the rest of your goddamn life!\nHello? Yes, speaking. Sir?!\n'The Man With No Face'? Oh, the director changed the name, no doubt. Yes, I starred.\nWhat? The premiere was a hit? Full house?\nDoes this mean I'm... back on track? Hold on? No, sir... I want to know right now—My makeup artist? She's right next to me. Huh?\nRight, the film exec's asking for you.\nWait, wait, Roberta, how did you manage to make it in Wrankwood this fast? Whatever your secret is, you've got to tell me...\n—I never once changed.\n......\nSo this is Wrankwood, huh, sir.",

Are there still those who seek the meaning of life from your embrace?\nI know you keep to yourself, but if those who seek your help are true to heart, I ask you to please guide them to the right path.\nO Helia, respected and majestic Helia. Are there yet simpletons who attempt to make their way to your summit merely for fame?\nPlease, let them return home safely after your punishments. They are young and immature. Please do not take away their future for your brief moments of fury.\nThe lands of Minos. Words cannot describe how beautiful you are, and nothing comes close to your magnificence.\nYet I must say these words and mark them down for prosperity.\nThese are only words that a Forte, far away from home, still has for comfort. Should these words go unsaid, these woes deep in my heart will endanger even my life.\nPlease forgive me for resorting to such shallow methods to compose myself.\nI will yet wander outside your domain.\nIt may take several years, perhaps decades.\nBut I promise you this.\nIt matters not how long.\nI will once again return to your embrace.\nThis is the truest, most sincere oath that a Minoan can take.\nI am certain you can hear me.\nThis rock, mined in Aegean, yet remains affixed to my hammer.\nWith it, I will make it through all obstacles in life.\nIt will bear witness to my faith, hear my odes, and execute these great deeds with me.\nAfter countless trials and tribulations, the melodies of my return shall be sounded.\nAt that moment in time, it will recant to you these writings of mine at the temple.\nI will ever hold out hope that this day will be soon.\n—Excerpts from some disorganized scribblings written by Pallas.",

Enter the HERO from backstage.)\nHERO: My dearest companions! Tonight, in this place, we finally gather.\nHERO: We rest our feet on the highest peak of Minos. We stand here and gaze as far as the eye may see, to the land covered by the radiance of the moons. All is our home.\nThe mountain spring flows forth from here, crosses untold hills, sweeps untold grasslands, and finally flows into the lake of the Aegean Plains, to become one with the blood of us all.\nWe owe it to our shared language, our shared folksong, our shared beliefs, that we stand here, to expel our common enemy. After tonight, so too will our blood unite.\nHERO: Let us drink together from a ladle of this spring water, and as we return in victory, we may then drink together from the mead this spring water creates.\n(The HERO, together with every FOLLOWER, imbibes wine. Timmy is still not of age. Please give him ginger ale instead.)\nHERO: I imagine we all, when we were born of this land and first opened our eyes, saw that our soil was ravaged by lowly intruders, and that our first wail was mingled with the invaders' satisfied jeers.\nWe have never seen the great and peaceful days spoken of in the epics, but we've no iota of doubt that this land we call Minos was of much different impression a century ago.\n(Performers begin to play here, growing gradually impassioned as the lyrics progress.)\n(Choir dances, and pairs off with Originium Arts.)\nHERO: Beneath the warm sunshine, the people contested in military fashion, yet did not endanger their lives, but simply tempered their wills and physiques; the crossing of words was not for epithets of hate, but for the pursuit of this land's deepest secrets.\nThe forests were not places to lay treacherous ambush, for Heria's thickets were of a different image in the verses; the rivers served as more than a channel to break the enemy front, for in them we could bathe and sing loud.\nHERO: The rose has need of the thorn's protection, and the beauty of our poems likewise ask for blade and shield to guard them. And we can use their petals to adorn our armor, and see their verses meld with our songs of war.\nHERO: Behold, for the moons are at their peak. Our victory in this war is as clear as this night sky. I believe it.\n(Turn lighting up to maximum.)\nHERO: Warriors, heroes, sharpen your weapons for the very last time.\nThe withered trees will turn to nourishment that feeds this land, and the ruins of the wild will become as foundations for our rebuilt splendor.\nTonight, we take back our faith, and we take back both the history and future of Minos.\n(The HERO raises their sword, and all FOLLOWERS pick up their weapons and line up. Choir chants. Curtains.)\n(Pay attention to number of weapons when inventorying props. DO NOT let real weapons get mixed in.)\n—From the third act of the Theater of Akroti's 'Light of Heria'. Pallas performs as the HERO CYPHUS, with a great deal of annotations and notes beside each of her lines.",

          "description": "The setting sun drops and bathes the empty street in afterglow. In the wake of a light sea breeze, it prints faint golden light across the mottled sign. A shop awaiting customers, a damaged high-rise stretching up, a short young palm tree—these things, seemingly forever frozen in the past, warp with the rays in the warm ripple of twilight. She turns the corner, reaches to fiddle with a plank door on the silent roadside. Ash-blackened wood splinters and an ash-blackened lock fall away, throwing up dust just as ash-black as the rest of it. Through cracks in the ash peek the street's original lacquer of red and blue.\nThere's no longer a sharp protrusion to be found in this city blanketed by volcanic ash; it seems to stand forever at the other end of the young girl's dreamland. She can hardly connect the view before her eyes with the stories Grandpa used to tell her. This is where those long-gone fiery summers and crystal-clear blue sparkling waters were—somehow, it was only ever scenes like those where his younger self in the stories could stand firm with his back straight, chanting work songs and spilling sweat. Even as the stiff shoulder straps dig painfully into her body, she clutches onto her rucksack tight, hands smeared in grime.\nIt's wrong. This is wrong. No one could live in a fantasy of the past, no one could possibly keep their fervor lit forever with just memories for firewood, and no one should spend their life asleep just to go back to how it was. It'll all end, and then things are born anew. She's experienced frightful desperation, the challenges of self-rejection and Oripathy, the melancholy of finding you don't stand out within the crowd—she's been through all of it. She doesn't want to just keep chasing forever. She's going to welcome new goals, passions, and achievements. The sun has completely set by now; she sees the lights in the distance. Those are the rays of the new Siesta.\nSo long, childhood dreams. It's time to head for the next stop.",

          "description": "Let me tell you a very boring story.\nThere are countless middle-class Columbian children living plainly favorable lives, who still attempt to assert their own individuality via what rebelliousness they've learned from others. Our hero for today is one such case.\nThe kids downtown never seem to exhaust their creativity or energy. Their skate tricks, graffiti art, and street rap hold a certain peculiar charm. No need for any means of intercity communication; it flourishes naturally in any urban center. Even the private school kids are captivated by this downtown 'ruff 'n' tuff stuff,' but discipline from their parents or teachers usually keeps them steering clear. They don't go out and experience the cool stuff for themselves.\nSo, our hero? His parents weren't for or against, they just didn't care, because our hero was a step ahead of the rest of his year. In whatever time was his own, he'd run off to hang out with those kids, but never actually joined in any of their activities. Maybe he was scared his classmates would mock him? Maybe he was scared that doing anything alongside the Infected would bring him trouble? Maybe he knew he wasn't like those kids, and in his heart raged all manner of emotions with nowhere to pour them? Who knows. All we know is that after the city passed a few new regulations quite unfriendly to the Infected, he put his self-taught knowledge to use and provided those kids some special new graffiti paints. If you ever tried to use water or any ordinary solvent to clean those walls, fresh anti-City Hall obscenities would show up over the works to disappoint you.\nYou think this story's actually veering on being interesting? Heh. Wait until I'm done. Yes, there's still more.\nYears later, those downtown kids are grown-ups now, saddled with what City Hall gave them, including the 'necessities for life' bundled along with their experimental weapons. They're on Pioneer Teams. I hear the forces they're part of took down a group of wicked barbarians like they were spraypainting across a map, opening up an ideal site for Columbia to build a nomadic city. The street culture they once also pioneered hasn't vanished since their departure, either. You could even say it's popular among all the youth of the city now, as a form of recreation.\nAnd what of our hero, you ask? He left the city, and never again encountered any graffiti from the throes of the heart, or skateboards in hand-painted livery. He found a job, and spends day in and day out either making more efficient weapons for his customers, or researching how to more efficiently destroy them.",

          "description": "This is a story from when Humus just came aboard.\nHearing they'd gotten a waste processing station's foreman from the Columbian frontier, several operators from Engineering had their curiosities piqued, wanting to see if someone with that kind of work experience had any special skills.\nWhen Humus checked in at Engineering, carrying his heap of trustworthy tools, clearly used for years, everyone present had quite the scare.\nFirstly, the box used to carry them was intimidatingly huge—only someone used to rough work like Humus could carry that thing about by one hand. Secondly, aside from the usual tools was a smorgasbord of bizarrely-shaped wonders whose usages were unclear, enough to perplex anyone who saw them.\nFortunately, Humus is the type who's happy to share. Over the next few hours, Engineering's operators gained a considerable boost to their knowledge.\n'This one's a multifunction remote control, with a lot of leeway for remodeling. Just do this... this... reassemble it quickly, and it'll transform from a TV remote to an RC detonator. It's high-power, has a huge effective range, and it's a treat to use.\n'This one's basically just an average hand cranked dynamo, but with a little souped-up functionality—it can generate electricity while it threshes corn or maybe peels potatoes. We were constantly out of power at the processing station, after all, and usually we only had corn or potatoes to eat.\n'As for this sickle, I made it out of a car door I pulled off. That car was a real funny one—after it came in written off, we had to shelve it for forever because it was just too rugged, and tearing the thing apart took some massive effort. I made the sickle's form overkill enough so if I pull it out and it scares people off, then that's one less pointless fight.'\nIt so happened that moments after the conclusion of this eye-opening equipment seminar, the bell sounded for dinnertime. Completely dazed, the operators of Engineering were itching to take this out-of-the-ordinary new colleague to the canteen for the welcome party they'd set up in advance. At the table, Humus told his curious coworkers a few stories, of people and things out on the frontier that in his eyes were just everyday life. Yet it was only after his captive audience had finished taking in his stories that they realized <i>why</i> Humus had the skillset that he did.\nThe frontier's not a place you survive with just the average Joe's common sense.",

We'll continue to stay within the rioters' encirclement, scout for intel, and await the backup team as well as the results of the negotiation.\nTwo excellent soldiers gave their lives on this mission. I'm filing to have bereavement paid to their families; the forms are attached to this report.\n(They were the youngest children in the squad. I recited farewell to them, so that they may find rest in these foreign soils. I believe, for my squad, that such a ritual must be done.)\n\n04 APR\nHaving not yet received further orders, my team has been laying bait as per the original plan, and locked onto a number of core enemy personnel as a result. Files are attached. We are ready to cut at the neck.\nWe expect to spend substantially longer in combat, so consumption of medical supplies will rise too. I'll dispatch a professional from the team to reexamine our contact channel; if the situation outside is dire, or the comms line is obstructed, she can provide you with some effective aid.\n\n10 APR\nI apologize for my rashness. After this is over, I will accept disciplinary action for my failure in this operation.\nMy team carried out a breakthrough under my command. I judged from meager information that other Victorian Army units had arrived at the enclave, and planned accordingly. We were required to make an opening for the ensuing force, carrying out our duty as an advance unit. Besides that, we had a shortage of supplies, so could not continue biding our time.\nAs the outcome shows, I made a grave lapse of judgment.\nI will record the callsigns and family names of each of the deceased.\nI pray this report arrives swiftly, and that we may receive our next orders.\n\n15 APR\nWe have successfully made contact with a force of the Redsteel Guard, and learned that other friendly forces are in fact present within the city; the news greatly heartens us. However, even they could not deliver us any valid orders.\nI apologize for the blood staining this paper; I am busy treating my wounded soldiers. There is no mission to report on here; this letter is simply... a plea for help. What exactly has happened on the outside?\n\n(dateless)\nI will be writing no further reports. I have no squad anymore.\nWhy has there been no reply? Why was our mission objective fake—our information too? Why did they have to die before their time?\nTo whoever receives this report—whoever—I DO NOT CARE WHO. I will not be returning to debrief at Command. The lives of those children weigh on me. I must atone, and so must you.",

          "description": "Dear Agni:\nThis is your first trip home in many years. We hear you've gone into business for yourself, and both your father and I are delighted to hear it. But you left in such a hurry, and so much was left unsaid. Since you decided to pack so light, I went ahead and sent you your old things. I wrote what I wanted to say on the item list here.\n[Half a box of matches]\nYou were three years old, trying to light a match the way the grown-ups do. You stuck the matchstick between your fingers. Your father rushed over, but you just giggled, waving your chubby little fists at him, and then the flame went out.\n[Worn-out lighter]\nSomeone gave this to you one summer before the start of school. It was broken, but you managed to actually fix it in time for the new term. Your father tried to take it several times, but seeing the excited look on your face as you spun it between your fingertips, he couldn't bring himself to do it.\n[High-end lighter]\nYou got it from Ashe before she went into the mines for the first time. You were about to go to high school in the city, and you didn't talk much with us anymore. We thought it was just a phase. But it wasn't until you came home for your eighteenth birthday that we learned Ashe had died in a mine accident and we realized we were wrong. You had a big fight with your father, and we knew things were more complicated than we'd thought.\nIt's been over a decade since then. At first, your father thought he should pass you the family business, so even if you didn't connect with us, you could still manage it in your own way, do as you would... you could even sell it! More than a business, we wanted to be able to have a heart-to-heart talk with our daughter.\nBut every time you two talked about it, you ended up fighting. And by the time you finished university, you'd lost all interest in talking to us.\n[Portable fire extinguisher]\nThis was supposed to be your eighteenth birthday present. We felt something like a sense of surrender when we settled on it. You liked playing with fire, and were pretty good at it. We accepted that, and hoped you'd always remember to quench the flames. Now it seems like we had nothing to worry about there.\nWhen you came home this time, we could see you'd grown a lot. No longer the young girl full of thoughts she couldn't express. But when we asked about your business and whether you needed help... you just smiled and said everything was fine.\nAgni, we know how stubborn you are, and how persistent, but... at least tell us about your troubles, let us offer some advice. Even if we'd just sigh and cry together, it's still better than the way things are. We don't even know what you've been through. Your father can only smoke on the deck, and I'm stuck here... writing this letter.\nThe reason I'm giving you this belated birthday gift is that I want to tell you that we respect your thoughts and wishes, and I hope you might... open up to us, every once in a while, won't you?\nPlease write back. It would make me and your father so very happy, honest and truly.\nLove, Your Mother",

          "description": "ORDERED BY / Operator Vendela:\nHi Deepcolor. These fragments came from a stained glass door back home. My grandpa made for my 12th birthday, and fitted it into my greenhouse. Then later on it got destroyed in the war, but I gathered up all the fragments and brought them with me to Rhodes. I planned to just leave them around as a keepsake, but then I heard you can restore stained glass, so I'm sending them to you. Fingers crossed you can make it good as new. Whatever it costs, it doesn't matter.\nThe shards are v. sharp. I've given each a run through soap suds and wrapped them up properly, but please be careful when you get them so you don't cut your hands.\nREPLY FROM / Deepcolor:\nHello. I can tell it was damaged in war; no wonder it's covered in so much grime. I'll need some time to clean it—please wait patiently in the meanwhile.\nREPLY FROM / Operator:\nThank you so much, would it be OK to ask you to save any soil you clean off?\nI know it's dirt, but it's my home soil. I've been raising a flower from home here, growth hasn't been ideal. Maybe it will be more comfortable if I fill its flowerpot with that soil.\nREPLY FROM / Logistics Department:\nAll good. Please come pick up your package tomorrow before 12.\nREPLY FROM / Operator:\nThank you\n(attached: A daisy)\nREPLY FROM / Deepcolor:\nRestoration work went very smoothly—you kept the fragments in such remarkable shape, I hardly found any trouble piecing it all together. However, red has seeped into several pieces' cracks, which is spoiling the original design. My suggestion is substituting those with pieces of brand new glass, onto which I can paint using the original design.\nREPLY FROM / Operator:\nSorry. I'm assuming the red in there is blood I accidentally spilled on it, I thought I managed to clean it all off.\nI think I need some time to consider. Would it be OK if you paused the restoration work for the moment?\nThank you.\nREPLY FROM / Deepcolor:\nIs something the matter, Vendela? I haven't been able to contact you all this time—the glass door has been with me for almost a month now.\nREPLY FROM / Operator:\nVery sorry, Deepcolor. I took a trip home.\nAll that blood on the glass reminded me of something I hate remembering. I once had to sprint through an alley covered in blood, it dripped all over the soil and left these black marks behind, I couldn't bear to look.\nBut on my trip back, I found it blooming with deep red roses in the same alley, maybe some seeds from my pocket fell too back then, and they took up that blood as nutrients, and then they bore flowers to all the sun and rain.\nI'd like to keep that bloodstained glass. Could you repaint on top with these gorgeous flowers if that's OK? They have blood's color, and its warmth too.\n(attached: One of my roses from home, I've used Arts to keep it fresh, in hopes you'll feel the beauty of it too)",

No child at that point in the Krukowska family was as gallant as her, and she became the knight they placed their hopes in.\nIwona was used to long-term life in the camp. Scarce on modern means of entertainment, she upheld the strictest work-rest cycle and physical training, all of it for one purpose, becoming a campaign knight—the bravest campaign knight of them all.\nTo the Krukowska family, attaining service as a campaign knight is the highest honor of them all. The ancient family defends at the borderlands, their backs to the prosperous clamor of Kazimierz's cities, facing the frostbitten winters of Ursus. Iwona grew up on stories of heroism, and grew a pure fear and longing for that dangerous, tumultuous battlefield like nothing else.\nThe day her family Knight Primus granted her the chalice, it ensured Iwona had no second thoughts. She beat pure hot blood with every pulse. She signed up to every arduous training regimen with no care for the risk, and improved herself through it. She never took notice of whatever grimy deals and nonsense slander laid behind those majestic ideals. She...\nShe ran too fast, forgot precautions were always called for in perilous circumstances, and just one negligent second would be all it took to brew a tremendous tragedy.\nIwona only forgot this one thing. Just one time.\nShe was mercilessly thrown to the ground in the open country. A lone person hurrying, a lone person wounded, a lone person helpless. Those wild beasts growing Originium crystals wailed at her in their death throes, piercing her eardrums. Those sharp Originium crystals, sent every way by the explosion, skewered a body that wouldn't move as she asked.\nMaking it on willpower until aid came running, Iwona was lucky to survive. But after that, she was thoroughly cut away from the life she used to live.\nThat chalice was placed in her display cabinet, separated by a glass door, and every time Iwona came home, she would wipe it clean.\nShe tried returning to her family afterwards, to at least see her own mother and father again one more time, go back into her room, take away some memories of hers—\nNot once more has she set foot through that heavy wooden door.",

A Sankta's gun.\nRichele remembers—the old man at church had a gun too. He treasured his gun like nothing else, wouldn't bring it out just for anything, but one time he let Richele touch it, because he was the same as him, a Sankta.\n'Young man, you should have a gun too.'\nThe old man looked into his eyes, seeming to mean something by it, though Richele wasn't quite able to tell what.\nShould he have a gun?\nIt wasn't something he'd ever thought about.\nHe'd always been pretty much like the other kids on his street. They whiled away the time wandering about the city, scuffling every which where, doing odd jobs for the famiglie, fighting over the right to play at some machine in the arcade and calling it a 'turf war'... If that described him, should he have a gun?\n'Young man, what are you getting distracted for right now?'\nThe Sankta before him gives him a light few nudges with the gun. \n'Aren't you scared? Aren't you worried I'll pull the trigger?'\n'You're not going to, Mister. Because... um, I heard, we can't hurt our own people? Isn't that how it works?'\nBut this was just sophistry.\nThou mayst not harm thy kin. That's what the old man at church said, and he thinks that's what he meant. He has some recollection of it, but he's never paid it much mind.\nRichele carefully scrutinizes the Sankta before him. Travel-worn, but with clothes all neat and tidy, and looking in good health.\nAre he and this person kin? It's hard to say.\n'You're not wrong. We can't point guns at our own people.'\nSays the Sankta. But. There's always a but—\n'*clack*.'\nThe sound of pulling a trigger.\nRichele holds his breath in that instant, and fiercely throws himself to the side. He feels no despair at this turn of events, he simply hopes he can avoid the fatal shot, and—\n'...Whuh?'\nHe feels a faint sting on his forehead. Something falls, sweeping past the bridge of his nose, and Richele grabs it.\nIt's a piece of candy.\n'And that's to say, nice to meet you.'\nThe Sankta grins, no longer tensed up like before. He gives the prank item that spat out the candy a spin around his finger, then hands it to Richele. 'We know you from the head of the chapel. He asked if we could pick you up on our way back.'\nHe shoots Richele a wink, and says:\n'What do you think, Richele? You want to get out of here... come with us, and live back in Laterano?'",
