Soon, a dazzling light. Gradually, the light grows distant and rises to the sky, leaving behind bright blotches. Not long after, these points of light themselves speed far away, and all that remains is a meaningless, jet black.\nYou remember those blotches are celestial bodies, every one. You remember the home of the stars is called the cosmos.\nThen immediately, your sight abruptly grows clear. Sleek metal. A sealed room. A clear window forms your third eye—through the window, you gaze at a colossal grey sphere, and in the center of that megastructure no normal mind could comprehend, it quietly awaits its birth father...\nYou suddenly feel a kind of movement. A fluid wets your vision. You begin to seek this emotion's root. You see a child's birth. It is your child. A brand new fate, a soul entrusted... But against that yawning megastructure, how insignificant a life of such miniscule proportions it is.\nYou return to the now, and gaze at those engineering ships, big and small. You, the mathematician, quickly make a ridiculous comparison—even the smallest ship among them is thousands of times larger than an infant of mankind.\nBut you have all done it. Starting from the antiquity of antiquity, starting with fire or a hunt, you have come all the way to today.\nYou are immensely proud. By some mysterious mechanism, you feel this pride as if it is yours, upon which more information pours into your mind. You remember your own identity. You realize that you are the designer of that artificial satellite. And after such a long journey in subspace, you finally greet the moment of its completion with your very own eyes.\nHonor, wealth, family, ideals... such vocabulary flickers elusive, hovers, dissipates, and in the end there is left one, and only one...\n...\n...\n'Future...'\n'What? What did you see?'\n'...'\n'Hey, respond! Hey!'\nAll present lapse into silence. A young woman to the side wells with urgency.\n'Examine his brain! I told you we shouldn't have been so hasty! We only just set up protocol channels to database comms! This is only our first recorded successful transmission!'\n'...I'm sorry.'\n'Wait. What are you saying?'\n'I mean... I never used to be too fond of you planetary engineers. I always felt your work was all style, no substance... but I saw it. I saw your past, I shared in your past. I felt your emotions. It was... like nothing else.'\n'You...'\n'Yes. I felt you reminisce, like an ordinary father, about your children and your home. I saw that artificial moon, astonishing as anything. And the sensation, it's beyond all imagination... We've done it.'\nOnce again, everyone is silent.\n'So...' The one to break the silence is a fairly young, red-haired lady. 'How will it record our epoch, and the epochs to come?'\n'As an omnibus of idiocy, I assume,' someone responds thoughtlessly. 'We've had quite enough ourselves, but from here on out, none of them will ever find another excuse to embellish history.'\n'Have a little more faith in mankind, friends,' says another, elderly, who simply sits down and shuffles herself into a comfortable position. 'We've drawn enough lessons already. Our progeny won't be repeating our blunders.'\nSome chuckle bitterly. It is, of course, no more than a beautiful wish.\n'...So we've definitely succeeded? Project DWDB-221E has borne fruit so quickly... My god.'\nWith no warning, a curly-haired person springs to his feet.\n'Are we always going to call it DWDB-221E? I know, project numbering follows regulation format. Cold, cold nomenclature, just like with AMa... But our work <i>deserves</i> a more dignified official name!' Once again, he throws out the proposal he hadn't relented on for more than half the year now. 'I want to call it... 'Destiny'! Or maybe 'Truth of the World'?'\nThe ensuing silence is now an awkward one.\n'How about the 'Black Crown'? In terms of an intuitive visual impression of parts of its appearance, it does resemble a crown, after all.'\n'Eh, not a fan. That one sounds like some boring historical drama.'\n'In that case...'\nThe elderly woman interrupts her subordinates before they embroil themselves in yet another endless dispute. She gazes out at the stars beyond the window. Some unwelcome information is arriving, but humanity will ultimately overcome this hardship, just as it has countless times before.\n'I have a proposal...'\n'We should call it—'Civilight Eterna'.'","name":"DWDB-221E","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30034","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30044","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_003_kalts":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Kal'tsit","profession":"Medic","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30061","count":4},{"id":"30031","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30012","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":4},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30043","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30053","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":6}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3261","count":5},{"id":"30022","count":8},{"id":"30052","count":5}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3263","count":4},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"30064","count":4}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_kalts_1","icon":"skchr_kalts_1","name":"Command: Structural Fortification","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"31013","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30094","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":9}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_kalts_2","icon":"skchr_kalts_2","name":"Command: Tactical Coordination","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"30043","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"30084","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_kalts_3","icon":"skchr_kalts_3","name":"Command: Meltdown","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30074","count":4},{"id":"30053","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31034","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30145","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_kalts","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"PHY","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_kalts","description":"Sand circles above. In the rays of light, no longer can she trust anything before her.\nVoices call to her. Souls lift her hide-wrought bag, turn her dazedness to weariness.\nShe sees a land without limit, a land rich with life. She feels something tightly grip her hand. She looks back, and in the haze of memory fumbles for her own name.\nKal'tsit.\nShe knows she was born into these ruins of civilization bearing a calling, but there is no one to shine a light on what is to come for her. Ultimately, she cannot live free from this calling. It is akin to taking a meal, or sleeping.\nShe begins to walk, walk upon the lost dust, carefully sorting through her myriad years of memories and knowledge. She sees a new nation rise from yet more ruins. She recalls how the result of her abandonment was deposed royalty. She sees fresh, novel flags howl atop the blood-soaked battlefield. She recalls how both sides of the war united against a common enemy in those ancient times.\nShe sees forests yet thinks of barrens, gazes on mountains yet recollects lakes—she walks through the river that is Time, picking up stones, while the eras surge, parting around her, rushing forward on.\nBut she is immutable. She has no past, and no future either.\nIt takes her a deal of Time before she has her thoughts reorganized. She remembers the last death. The years stretching long enough to see the form of life itself change. Still, she never thought death would be so fast; some things are changing at this very moment.\nLives flourish without rhyme or reason, and the land morphs and fluctuates. Man-made machines operate with a rumble, the radiance of Originium energy shining into the umbra. In the dark, the people struggle, yearning for the light, scorning shadow in an age of brilliance, on and on. Her countenance is concealed by the flurry of grit stirred by a nomadic city, and she feels anxious to the depths of her heart.\nDoes the will that hid the stars behind the false sky still watch the surface recur in its rise and fall? How long until the Terrans, so proud of their thriving civilizations, personally send those same civilizations into the ice-cold void, to join countless lost lives?\nTime is running short. This is what Kal'tsit tells herself. She has fallen to blaming herself. She has wasted too much Time, and at so many moments barely averted the self-destruction of Terra, barely led them to a safe place to develop. It has exhausted her, drained her.\nShe is no omniscient, omnipotent being. And yet, she tasks herself with tending to the entire World.\nHer calling was never a fair one.\nShe has to hurry. She has to do whatever it takes.\nHer gaze comes to rest on a shattered Kazdel. It is far from the first time she's touched on the legend of the Lord of Fiends. In the boundless years, more than once she has thought of retrieving and exploiting this ancient force. She cannot help but stifle her memories of the Teekaz—to make an effort not to long for the bygone days where Originium had not yet molded life into its present form, and not to commemorate a possibility that has long since vanished.\nMaybe this time, it's time she made up her mind.\n......\n...\n'So this was your previous journey, Kal'tsit.'\n'It stretches longer than the fragment you've seen.

Occasionally, she looked out into the distance, and sometimes down at her feet. It was as if the ship called Rhodes Island was hiding something from her. Until a young vampire stepped forward, holding a stack of documents. Hesitating slightly, Closure interrupted Kal'tsit's thoughts.\n'Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals Inc.' Closure feigned a smile, swallowing her memories, and decided to continue, 'The work on this side of Rim Billiton is already done. Whew, those rabbits are a pain, none of them're as cute as Amiya. They wasted so much of our time, insisting the ship was registered for ore hauling...'\nClosure paused.\nFortunately, Kal'tsit snapped out of her reverie in time and gently responded in an almost soothing tone, 'Thank you for your hard work.'\n'What's next?'\n'Continuing the discussions we didn't finish in the last meeting.'\n'Are we going to lose more people?'\n'More people will leave.' Kal'tsit gazed into the distance where the wandering merchant had packed up, 'They belong to Babel, not Rhodes Island. I just hope there won't be any more bloodshed between us.'\n'I understand, but—'\nA voice interrupted the two.\n'Dr. Kal'tsit? Closure?'\nThe moment she heard the voice, a gentle and caring look flashed in Kal'tsit's eyes, but she quickly composed herself. 'Amiya, you should be resting.'\n'I'm fine. I just had another nightmare.' Amiya tugged at her collar, the wind was strong, and she was small, 'The trip to take the Doctor to Chernobog, and the days we spent in the wilderness... those Sarkaz warriors...'\nKal'tsit and Closure exchanged a quick glance. Closure understood what Kal'tsit meant; after all, both Ascalon and Ace visited Amiya often.\nThey didn't say anything; Amiya could sense it now as well.\n'Yes. They chose to be our enemies.'\n'Why?'\n'Because they live under the beautiful promise of Babel. They don't want to give up that illusion. And to them, we are deserters.'\n'Is Miss Theresa's promise an illusion?'\n'To them, yes.' Kal'tsit stood quietly beside Amiya and reached out to pat her head; she had grown a little taller. 'But they believe that continuing the war will solve all their problems.'\n'They're not entirely wrong, though.'\nKal'tsit was slightly surprised for a moment. She looked at Amiya, gazing at this tired and lost girl for a long time, until she finally felt a sense of relief. 'You're right, Amiya. They're not entirely wrong.'\n'What about the Doctor? Is Ursus safe?' Amiya looked up at Kal'tsit. 'I miss the Doctor a bit.'\nThis innocent gesture made Kal'tsit slightly flustered. At that moment, Closure embraced Amiya from behind.\n'Look, Amiya!'\nAmiya looked and saw an unfamiliar Rim Billitonian merchant, kicking up dust in the distance. The sand-covered cart tied with packages appeared heavy, and somehow cute.\nClosure playfully smiled and held Amiya even tighter.\n'Rhodes Island's journey is just beginning.

The buildings are like a forest torn apart by a whirlwind, collapsed in a radius surrounding a singular point. In these ruins of the Empire, two figures turn over a toppled stele, attempting to find higher ground.\n'How long has this place been empty?' Ch'en stands atop the rubble and looks into the distance. The names on the stele behind her once stood for glory, now all but worn away.\nBagpipe's voice comes from somewhere below. 'This school buildin's been abandoned since the war broke out. All the students who didn't complete their course yet got sent off to new campuses, finished the rest out there... Chenchen, that's our old trainin' grounds up in front.

The moment I graduated, they finished repairing the roads, <i>and</i> the training grounds.'\nThe training grounds have been blown by the shockwave into a plate of jagged protrusions. Ch'en picks up a stone, flings it into a shrub sticking out of a crack in the plate, and a fowlbeast hiding within flies off for somewhere far away, screeching and cawing all the while.\n'Things were good enough as is, back then.' Bagpipe's voice comes in close as she stops and stands by Ch'en's ear.\n'True. It was probably the simplest time of my life. I didn't have all these issues weighing on my mind, I just had to focus purely on training and studying.'\n'That's what drove you? You trained like a maniac every day, got As on every standard subject and all.' Bagpipe clasps her hands on Ch'en's shoulders, and gently rocks back and forth.\n'After I returned, I realized just how many things couldn't be solved with swords. There were times I felt far too insignificant, and that even though I worked hard, I couldn't change all that much—sometimes, taking out the enemy doesn't do a thing to address the problem.' Ch'en shakes her head, as if trying to throw her tangled mess of feelings about the past straight out of her brain.\nThe two of them head up a steep slope. The flowerbed is still where they remember it.\nHalf of the logo of the once-eminent Royal Guard Academy is submerged in the mud, the other half resting against a fractured stone pillar.

She was meant to describe it further, but it was just too ordinary. Its wood was bottletree timber, the kind you'd see everywhere in Rim Billiton. It was her sixth birthday present. Her mom used to take her hand in hand and teach her how to play, along with all the funniest rhymes for how to keep her position straight, not that she could really remember them now. The only words of advice she could still recall were: playing the violin isn't about bowing whatever way the sheet tells you to. It's about painting your own feelings onto the strings.\nAnd Amiya had tried, but the violin wouldn't sing with clear melodic tones, just shrieks and wails. One string violently twisted and flinched, like it was cowering in a customs inspection line, hiding with apprehension as deep as possible in the crowd. As if doing that would somehow escape the contrast-scanning gate at the queue's head and the shrill alarms it would inevitably set off. Another string began to shrink away as fast as it could, like it'd been shoved headfirst into a team of miners, left to shiver and curl up into a ball. Anything to conserve what little heat was left, to get just that tiny bit further from the bloodstained whips. The third string shook like it was going mad as active Originium dust glittered in the air, compounding the abandoned warehouse's smell of blood and rot to form a stench that no human could possibly bear. The final string sat amidst sharp animalistic cries and screamed why? why? why? And no string could answer that question. Coming back to her senses, each of the violin's strings had snapped under tension, and its body had been scorched a cerulean-black.\nAmiya tied the filled-out card around the violin's neck, and laid the broken instrument into the box with the greatest care. Many other things were in there too—the Doctor had caught an Originium Slug while out on a trip and fashioned its shell into this whistle, and Miss Theresa had knitted this hat that made such a funny sound when you pulled on it, and Dr. Kal'tsit had personally engraved this monitor band with animal motifs for her... They all carried those cerulean-black scorch marks, and now they laid in this box, waiting until they saw the light of day again.\nWhen? <i>When the flames of wrath across the land have quelled,</i> Amiya thought subconsciously, <i>when the nameless wrath roiling in her chest is no longer there to burn them.</i> But when would that be? Would she be there to see it? She had no idea.\nJust before she closed the lid, she caught sight of a tiny little dent made in the violin's side. Not a scorch mark, it was—she remembered—it was made just after she'd got it. She had thrown the bow at the violin, because she could never play it in tune. She left that mark out of anger.\nAmiya laughed. The wrath roiling in her chest might be nameless and senseless, but this little spark of almost petulant rage was one she was all too familiar with. It was one she could understand, one she could keep in check.\nShe saw her little self, puffing her chest out and telling her mom, I know what anger is now. It's when you can't figure out why things never go the way you picture them. I can hear all the music notes in my head, but all I can do is make a silly mess out of it. So she would try and try again, until she'd never play a bum note again, until she'd never get angry about her own clumsiness again. Little Amiya promised her mom, she'd never smack her bow on anything again, because it wouldn't solve a thing.\nAnd so, Amiya took the ravaged violin out of the box. Maybe tomorrow, or the day after, she'd mend it up, and then try to play it once more.","name":"Anger to be Tuned","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31024","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31034","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_101_sora":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Sora","profession":"Supporter","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30041","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30062","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30013","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30023","count":3},{"id":"30043","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3271","count":4},{"id":"30042","count":4},{"id":"30062","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3273","count":3},{"id":"30074","count":9},{"id":"30013","count":17}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_sora_1","icon":"skchr_sora_1","name":"Hymn of Respite","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30034","count":3},{"id":"30013","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":3},{"id":"30034","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30054","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_sora_2","icon":"skchr_sora_2","name":"Hymn of Battle","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"30023","count":1}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30064","count":2},{"id":"30044","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30094","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_sora","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"BAR","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_sora","description":"A silver nanny van enters a Penguin Logistics safehouse's closest dropoff point.

Yes, it is Song.\nOnce, a lone technician had sung this. No matter what seas she swam, it was by herself, trailing hundreds upon thousands of optical cables behind her. The technician deftly strummed these optical cables, and amidst swirling halos sang to schools of indifferent fins that passed her by.\nOnce, a lone wandering singer had sung this too. No matter what lands she walked, it was by herself, trailing tune after tune of memories behind her. The singer wove those memories into ditties, and in rundown inns sang to crowds of indifferent souls.\nIn this moment He Himself is lone, trailing every breadth of creation He engulfed behind Him, drifting through a dying universe to the ends of Time. So in this moment, should He not sing too, to those indifferent nutrients within His body?\nSkadi certainly would. While complex problems still lay on her mind to puzzle through, her Song would well forth—for Song was her language, her imagination, her creation.\nSo Skadi begins to sing. And in her Song, Skadi begins to blossom, more fiercely and ardently than any life that has ever blossomed before. Dimly, Skadi realizes the act she is about to undertake. With the beginning of this Song, those indifferent nutrients within her body will birth new existence, new life, a new universe.\nViolently her body expands, and rapidly her consciousness scatters, and filled with hope she imagines the brand new universe she will never witness.","name":"An Exuvia of Her Past","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30135","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_1013_chen2":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Ch'en the Holungday","profession":"Sniper","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30041","count":5},{"id":"30021","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30062","count":3},{"id":"30032","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30083","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30093","count":4},{"id":"30013","count":5}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3241","count":5},{"id":"30032","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":6}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3243","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"31024","count":6}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_chen2_1","icon":"skchr_chen2_1","name":"High-Pressure Splash","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"30043","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_chen2_2","icon":"skchr_chen2_2","name":"'Night of Violet'","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30074","count":4},{"id":"30053","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31034","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_chen2_3","icon":"skchr_chen2_3","name":"'Holiday Storm'","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30084","count":4},{"id":"30063","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30094","count":9}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30145","count":6},{"id":"30064","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_chen2","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"RPR","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_chen2","description":"Looking at the boy in front of her, Ch'en is somewhat taken aback.\n'Your mother?

The boy gritted his teeth. 'My dad once promised that after making enough money, he'd take my mom and me on a cruise, and we could see a rainbow over the sea from there. But he never kept his word. He just kept chasing dirty money, forcing me to work with him, and now he wants to drag my mom down with him too. I can't stand it anymore.'\nCh'en notices bruises on the boy's neck. With her years of experience, she instantly knew he was telling the truth.\n'...Don't worry. If what you say is true, I'll make sure your father and his crew get the punishment they deserve.'\nAt the word 'punishment,' the boy, who had kept his head down, suddenly looks up. 'Does prison really change people?'\n'...Why do you ask?'\n'My dad wasn't like this before. Ever since we came to Dossoles, he's been obsessed with making money. I don't even know when he changed... maybe he's always been this way. But I can't forget the look in his eyes when he first told me he'd take me on a cruise to see a rainbow.'\nLooking at the boy, Ch'en is reminded of her past self. Back then, she had always wanted a certain someone to notice her sword. But at some point, she stopped hoping for that.\n'This city is surrounded by water. Rainbows should be easy to find here. Haven't you seen enough of them?'\n'...No. I have to see a rainbow with him, on a cruise; nothing else counts.'\nYes, it only counts if he's there.\n'Hah. And you still want that, even now?'\n'Yeah.' There is a faint glimmer of hope in the boy's eyes, but it quickly fades. 'But I can't do it alone.'\nCh'en is silent for a moment, then grabs her water gun and walks in the direction the boy had indicated. Before going, she leaves him with a final piece of advice.\n'Then you'll have to find a way to make your father listen to you. Make him understand that you want him to change... At the very least, let him know what you're thinking.'\nThat day, there was a sudden downpour in Dossoles. In the rain, Ch'en saved a woman from a group of criminals and subdued the culprits.\nStrangely, just as the gang leader was about to fight back, a child suddenly stepped between him and Ch'en. The rain had stopped at some point, and a rainbow arched across the sky. Beneath it, the gang leader hesitated, and the child seemed to say something to him. Finally, the leader lowered his weapon.\nWitnesses nearby reported that, although Ch'en had successfully resolved another smuggling case, she didn't seem happy. She simply looked off to the east, lost in thought.","name":"Beach Combat Suit","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30155","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_chen2","cnOnly":true,"typeName1":"RPR","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_chen2","description":"清晨的空气还带着一丝凉意，陈正在帮老米哈伊尔劈柴。\n不一会儿，她数了数旁边堆起的木柴——这些应该够老米哈伊尔用了。\n她舒了一口气，然后开始盘算，接下来要做些什么。\n上午，她答应了斯维特拉娜，去看看刚修好的工坊，然后和她一起烘焙饼干。\n中午，老米哈伊尔请她去家里吃午饭。她想顺道请这位老工匠帮她修一下那件蒸汽骑士模型——一个维多利亚人送的礼物。\n下午，她要跟老米哈伊尔一起去田里看看。为了消灭害虫，她跟老米哈伊尔研究了好几天怎么用她那把水铳喷洒农药，今天是测试的日子。\n晚上......对了，信使今天会来这座镇子，多索雷斯那边的信也该来了。他们比她想象的要热情，经常写信给她汇报近况......她打算给他们制定一套新的训练计划。对了，再写封信给文月夫人报个平安吧。\n真忙。这么想着，她迈开了脚步，这时，一个青年拦住了她。\n青年是斯维特拉娜的儿子，镇子自卫团的一员，陈在之前代替自卫团做了一些事，从那以后，青年就一直想要拜她为师。\n“告诉我怎么才能变得像你这样强吧，陈姐！”\n“回去坚持每天挥剑吧。”\n陈并没有骗青年。\n对陈晖洁来说，练剑曾是生活的头等大事。在龙门时，无论风吹雨打，或是有再多公务，她总要抽出时间练剑。\n“可是，你来我们镇子这么久，我从没见过你练剑。”\n青年的话让陈微微一愣，她忽然想起来，自己确实有段时间没有练剑了。\n不知何时起，这件事对她来说没有那么重要了，或者说，没有那么紧迫了。她今天的那些安排和练剑同样重要——\n她忽然意识到，自己过去并不会这么想。\n但是，当她想到过去的自己，想到那个不断想要证明什么的陈晖洁时，她发现，自己有一种难以言喻的自信——\n现在的赤霄一定比过去更利。\n不，是她的剑一定比过去更利。\n“你想看吗？”\n“欸？”\n在青年的眼中，奇妙的一幕发生了。陈只是换了一个姿势，仅仅是这样一动，上一秒，她的手中还空无一物，但此时，他却看到了一柄“剑”出现在她的手中。\n这柄“剑”让青年产生了巨大的危机感，他忍不住想要逃离，然而，他感觉自己无法行动，只能眼睁睁地看着那柄“剑”挥向自己。他忍不住闭上了眼。\n“剑”当然没有挥向青年，陈只是拍了拍他的肩膀。\n“走吧，你的母亲在等我们呢。”\n青年这才睁开眼，远处，母亲斯维特拉娜正站在田埂上招呼他们去工坊。陈先一步向着斯维特拉娜走去，青年急匆匆地跟上陈的脚步，兴奋地问道：\n“陈姐，只要每天坚持挥剑，我也能做到你刚才那样吗？”\n“不够，还要走路，走很多很多的路。”\n陈抬头看了看天，今天日头正好，是个出行的好天气。","name":"假期的最后一天","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30155","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30145","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30165","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_1014_nearl2":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Nearl the Radiant Knight","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30011","count":6},{"id":"30061","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30032","count":4},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30093","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30103","count":3},{"id":"31023","count":5}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":5},{"id":"30062","count":5},{"id":"30052","count":4}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":8}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_nearl2_1","icon":"skchr_nearl2_1","name":"Flaming Edge","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"31043","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31044","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":9}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_nearl2_2","icon":"skchr_nearl2_2","name":"Night-Scouring Gleam","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"31013","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30094","count":9}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"31014","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_nearl2_3","icon":"skchr_nearl2_3","name":"Blazing Sun's Obeisance","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"30043","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31014","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":10}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30145","count":6},{"id":"30014","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_nearl2","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"DRE","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_nearl2","description":"Margaret, clad in a full suit of armor, clutches a wooden swordstaff in hand, focusing her attention on confronting the man in front of her. \nThe wooden sword swaying gently in his hands reveals no hostility at all, but Margaret knows that if she lets her guard down even for a second, that sword would bypass her swordstaff and lightly tap her on the head. \nUsing the range advantage of her swordstaff, Margaret repeatedly probes her opponent.

I recall when first we met... it was rare to see someone so composed, so at peace. That, Liz and I knew better than anybody. Here, her sister sleeps over her knees, muttering a word or two from time to time, but The Radiant Knight holds still, unstirring. Estranged for so many years, she elects, quietly, simply, to watch over her family. Whislash—Zofia—does not disturb the two. In fact, she combs Nearl's hair and tail for her. The Radiant Knight's locks are matted with blood, blood of the shadows. Shadows whose echoes are stayed outside of this bar, peaceful as it is, for a time.\nLiz is somewhat drowsy, but adamant not to rest. We have much to say to The Radiant Knight, to Operator Nearl of Rhodes Island, to Margaret. Fortunate or misfortunate it may be, but I am familiar with her entirety, her every part.

Yet we each have our own matters to face, and indeed, these matters are leagues unalike.\nMaria wakes, comes to find she's been sleeping on her sister, and flushes somewhat. Zofia makes sharp barbs, scolds the two on their less than model appearances. She is dwarfed by Nearl by some centimeters, and without realizing, always cranes her head to speak to her; the posture seems a strain. It <i>is</i> rude of me, but I cannot help scrutinizing Whislash's expression as she stands before The Radiant Knight. Is there defiance in what she feels? Does she long to fight alongside her, shoulder to shoulder? Does she place her ideals and convictions into this knight of flesh and bone?\nAnd how is it that <i>I</i> see Margaret?

It makes sense; I've always detested my lineage, its supposed beauty something I've never tasted. Such love, such meaning in family, by all rights belong to her, and are to be celebrated and kept in sight. While by all the same rights, I do not belong here, and should find my own path.

Hence, I've given up on saying what need not be said. I smile silently back at her, and that is all.\nThe original sin of a Confessarius is not in a place of pure darkness. Light has been foretold.\nWe find ourselves in the shadows. This, in spite of each of our shadows' oracles being our own, each a different soothsayer.\nMargaret pushes the tavern door open, saying what comes to mind. —A knight should examine herself, survey herself, to discipline as disciplined. We must become our own light.

Londinium's newest fad—The Adventure of the Lioness. There were only so many ways to kill time in the pubs right now, and this game for kids quickly found a home among pubgoers who loved picking at politics.\nTo all that, the Doctor replied: 'Closure and I see plenty of unpatched holes in the game design.'\nShe prepared to deploy her standard suite of excuse-mes and beat a hasty retreat, but Closure had already sealed off her escape route, and was urging her to join in. 'I can vouch. This game really takes me back to those days, you know? Underground in Londinium, fighting with the Self-Salvation Corps.'\nAnd how was she to predict that a fun little idea from a couple of kids playing house would get snapped up, commercialized, shipped, and become all the rage in Londinium? And then the greatest surprise was Morgan gleefully bringing the game back to the landship and recommending it to everyone she possibly could.\n'I'll play as you.' Taking on the 'Vina' role, the Doctor readied for the other two players' assault. Dice rolled again and again, and each time City Keeper 'Vina' came out on top, even twice succeeding in a complete counteroffensive and taking the 'Caster' territory for 'herself'.\nDefeated time and time again by 'herself', Vina was somewhat exasperated. 'Doctor, this is cheating. Hardly anything you're doing is in the rulebook.'\n'We never agreed to play by anyone else's rules, Vina.\n'Londinium's an enormous city. There are plenty to draw on that the designers didn't know or care about. That's what I meant by holes.'\nFor a moment, Vina thought to herself, then threw herself decisively into the next round. The aftermath of an independent Tara, the strategic give-and-take of Caster, the Infected vanguard bearing news of Gododdin... Vina played character after character, trying with all her might to wrest the Doctor's advantage away, but always to minimal effect.\nBefore her eyes was a city that far surpassed her expectations. With a peculiar and twisted ambition, she sought to beat 'herself'.\nBut it was beyond her to read any of the strange and crafty angles by which the Doctor defused her offensives. Their tiny little board couldn't support the three's game anymore. With a flash of inspiration, Closure called directly on PRTS to simulate one that was even larger and more complex.\n'Uh. Closure, are you allowed to use PRTS like that? What if Dr. Kal'tsit—'\nClosure waved it off. 'She's got urgent business, she's not on the ship. Besides, I have the permissions to guarantee she'll never find out what we did.'\nAn absurdly protracted ten hours later, Vina finally had to excuse herself from the game thanks to an anonymous express delivery to her dormitory.\nWhat had arrived was the yet-to-be-published first expansion for the game, including a series of all-new powers with all-new game plays. There was Normandy, Ashworth, and the Unicorn. Printed on the box was a roadmap for future expansions and updates, too.\n'The Adeptus Chamber Knights, the Empire's Blades, the Agents of Operation Boulder, the Twins' Voices, and the Angels of Judgement...'\nAnd finally, a message that left Vina silent.\n'I hope you like it!

Her sister stands behind her in her shadow, watching as she puts on a deathly heavy crown. She feels it's wrong for her to be wearing it, but she can't take it off no matter how she tries; all she can do is melt it by fire. Metal trickles down her face, scalding, searing, but the idea of the purple flame bringing her comfort, ice-cold, scares her more. So she makes not a sound.\nAnd she recalls two people she met while pursuing the high-speed battleships' tracks a few days ago, ordinary folk. They knew the name of Dublinn—their land showed scars from being razed by fire. They asked Reed point-blank, are you the one who ruined our lives? The Draco, manipulator of the flame of life, fell silent for a while. She was familiar with the fear her sister could leave in people. But in the end, she nodded, for she is the Leader of Dublinn, and the Tarans have no need for two Dublinns.\nSomeone is calling her name. She leaves, through the tight wooden door.\n—She crosses a threshing floor, filled with hay and cardboard stage props of every color.\nHer costume's a little cumbersome—everyone wanted to drape their own two sashes over her, in much the manner one nestles two flowers for their beloved in a buttonhole. Surely the Red Dragon didn't take to the battlefield like this a millennium ago.\nBut no matter. They don't have to trouble themselves with the looks of the crown-bearer. Let the wandering minstrels suppose, for the sake of a rhyme, that the Draco hero of legend had hair just as flowing and golden.\nReed clears her throat and swishes her tail, a little wary. The Tarans in front of her don't know how each brook of muddy waters tracing through the marsh is the track of a galloping warship. They don't know that the bleak clouds to the north that never blow this way are the fumes of war. They don't know that what Reed grasps is the very flame of the Red Dragon of Tara. They simply know it's important to still have food to eat after their taxes are levied, and it's as important to make sacrifice and perform theater so their farmwork is bountiful and blessed. Sat in the back are the soldiers who've fought all the way alongside her, and they look at her just as expectantly. They've taught Reed that a failure to learn the lines means no good harvest in the coming year.\n'I give you land, and I give you the weather to nurture it.'\nA fire ignites at her speartip in time with her words, and the audience abruptly settles down. At this moment, all could swear they have some vague premonition as to who it is that stands before them.\nReed lowers her head. A child places a floral garland on her head of every color under the sun, each flower a symbol of a growing, flourishing crop.\nIt is light, almost weightless.

I saw a teammate ahead to my left who hadn't noticed the danger behind him, so I went to go help him. I acted without warning, and didn't expect to get hit by a training bolt. I caused the mission to fail right then and there. The instructors said no one should be making such a basic mistake. I was so embarrassed.\n'Shh.

How she'd made her own mistakes—ones just like mine today—how she'd gotten into massive arguments with her teammates over a disagreement in the field, how she had all these pranks of hers, and how she'd remodeled her crossbow.\nAnd at the very end, I'd finished the cake, and put the chocolate in my bag.

How about her hometown itself?\nThe music comes to a crackling halt.\nLaurentina opens her eyes, and what gradually seeps into view is her familiar ceiling. She knows, terrifyingly, she'll get even more used to this environment in time. She's not panicked about it. In order to panic in a new environment, you need to not want to leave the old one, but she's practically forgotten just how her life in Ægir felt to live.\nFrom the record box she now pulls a sawblade, and gently wipes over it, swapping for a new record to continue playing all the while. Maybe, just as the Iberians used all the methods under the sun to record their Golden Age, she can try and get back into her once most beloved activity—sculpting.\nHer one stroke of luck: she might just be stuck away from home for a good while longer. She still has enough time to remember how it looked, she thinks, with no lack of self-mocking irony.","name":"'Vinyl Record' Box","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30145","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30125","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_ghost2","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"PUM","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_ghost2","description":"'It is as if slaughtering those overgrown cuts of meat has become our unignorable, even our one-and-only, calling.'\nThe clock ticks and tocks. The dreadnought obstructs the rays as they come down from the dome. Ulpianus lifts his head and fixes his eyes on the flickering indicator lights, as if in thought.\n'It ought not be,' the young female Consul replies, following a long hesitation.\n'Of course it ought not. When an Ægir wakes, the first thought that enters their mind should not be of what they've lost, never. Nor of how to take back what they've lost.' Ulpianus is silent for a juncture, some kind of emotion flowing about his raspy throat. After a good while, he sighs, 'Oh, how many magnificent works we once made.'\n'And now, the battle to survive has become the only to-do list that this new generation knows.'\n'Battle. A glorious word, to be sure. And yet, our outstanding creativity and pursuit of beauty have been all but forgotten.'\nThe two simultaneously gaze afar. Lights dazzle beneath the dome.\n'...Not by choice.' Ulpianus adds.\nGladiia shoots a glance at Ulpianus, mulls over the wording for a moment, then speaks inquisitively: 'You were never the type to be so receptive to sentimentality.'\n'Indeed.' Ulpianus does not halt this time. 'We should address this matter solemnly. Our culture is in the midst of being permanently altered by these protracted days of calamity.'\nA colossal rumbling cuts short Gladiia's pregnant pause. More ships are entering port, a new fleet of migration and reconstruction, and she is left to ponder in earnest what Ulpianus has said. Over the pursuit of beauty, over the creation of the new. Before she was born, or perhaps earlier than that... centuries ago? Millennia? When the Ægir founded this stark and grand culture—did they imagine that now, its radiance would be so dull?\nDid they make any preparations for the present day?\nGladiia's thoughts are lost for but an instant. To her, the past is of unimportance. More vital are what preparations she is soon to make, what things she <i>can</i> do.\n'A new Abyssal Hunter.' Ulpianus unceremoniously breaks the silence. 'I hear she previously had quite an interest in the arts. Ballet, opera, she's dabbled in it all.'\n'Laurentina has mentioned a rather profound recollection of the sculpture in her hometown.'\n'Then she still retains some of the essence what all Ægir should have by rights.' Ulpianus turns around. The Consul's light attire for the season cannot conceal his body scarred by experimentation. 'What is she like? If she truly is an epitome of Ægir life from days gone by, then being forced away from the proper course of things must fill her with so much hate.'\n'No. Such sentimentality is but a small supplement to her whole.'\nGladiia breaks into a rare smile. This, despite how her smiles always took careful observation and judgment, on the muscular and nervous levels.\n'She creates a beauty of her own through battle. One of the sorts you speak of, with great exuberance.'\nUlpianus makes a light and noncommittal harrumph in response, after which he soon leaves Gladiia by herself under those gigantic shadows to appreciate the serenity.\nThe grand hall echoes with only the sounds of the Ægir's footsteps forward.","name":"The Beauty in the Incomplete","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30125","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_1024_hbisc2":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Hibiscus the Purifier","profession":"Medic","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30021","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"31013","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31023","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3261","count":4},{"id":"30062","count":3},{"id":"30012","count":4}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3263","count":3},{"id":"30074","count":9},{"id":"30013","count":18}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_atk_up[3]","icon":"skcom_atk_up[3]","name":"ATK Up γ","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"31053","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"31044","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_hbisc2_2","icon":"skchr_hbisc2_2","name":"Nurturing Touch","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"31024","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"31044","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_hbisc2","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"INC","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_hbisc2","description":"'Got all your mail for today here!

We're not meant to leave non-staff with odd jobs like this, especially not when you've just recovered from your injuries, and you're still an active Oripathy patient on top.' Hibiscus hands her a small origami floret, then takes in each parcel one by one—this one is bed 6; this letter goes to the old man in bed 13; this giant but feather-light box is for the girl in ICU 5, and inside is probably the doll they mentioned buying her last time...\n'Don't be like that! I can move around on my own two feet now—do you really want me lazing about in bed?' The woman secures her travel jacket, fastidiously fastening the topmost two buttons and nestling the paper flower in her collar. 'I'm a Messenger by trade.

It's what I've been. Heading everywhere and back again, that's my life. A few bumps and scrapes can't do more than put that on hold.'\n'Oripathy's more than a bump and a scrape, you know.

Then the fuel burned out, erupting in pungent smoke and dazzling sparks, spurring a moment of tremendous brightness before plunging them into darkness again.\nHe was now quite familiar with this pitch-black wilderness, devoid of light and any other people besides himself.

Maybe it could provide stable power to a village, perhaps it could fill in a missing piece of a technical puzzle, or maybe it would amount to nothing more than a dazzling but useless spark.\nHe was no longer afraid of the darkness, but he still grew tense, fearing that he might not even produce a spark this time.\n'Don't be scared, boy. I work at the poor house, I've seen too many dying people surrounded by loved ones. In times like those, all emotions mean something, just don't be afraid, fear doesn't help.'\nThe device flickered to life, disturbing the fireflies, causing them to flutter and fly farther into the wilderness, where they were quickly swallowed by the darkness.\nThe light illuminated the night, but it quickly dissipated within the dark, not even managing to burst into a spark.\n'Another failure...'\nGreyy slumped to the ground in despair.

Hence, their need to file a little additional registration. It doesn't mean they can use weapons in urban areas, but simply that under certain circumstances, their weapons will be returned to them.\nWhich is not to say she has to go through something as dumb as weapon NAMING, of course, it's just—she sees Exusiai elatedly wracking the ol' noggin and filling in names she came up with a second ago for each one of her guns, and she catches the gaze Exusiai throws her way from time to time— appreciation mixed with eagerness—and she knows that if she doesn't do it herself, Exusiai will snatch away her paperwork and give her two new swords names so stupid you'd call them groundbreaking.\nShe really can't say she's all that invested in these blades, given that she only reluctantly accepted them as a gift in the first place. Frankly, she's not even the type to get hung up on this stuff—if the swords she'd been using before weren't of fairly unique make, she'd probably have changed weapons several times over by now.\nMoreover, the maker of these twin swords was doubtlessly trying to draw some sort of... spiritual thing from the story of the Texas family name, which was then affixed squarely on top. And despite the fact that it made even more headache for her, it led even the official inspecting her weapons to cast her an expectant look, as if to say 'surely, arms such as these must have wonderful names.'\nThe door opens with a groan, and in come Sora and Croissant toting bags of all sizes. Their new base is in dire need of dressing up, and the two of them have always been on decor duty.\n'Oh my gosh, Texas, you've been sitting there for three hours,' Sora can't help but exclaim when she finds, after moving to Texas's side, that the form is still in the exact same shape as when she left.\nTexas gives a shrug of the shoulders, hands the pen to her, and makes it clear: Texas is checked out.\n'I'm busy sorting out the base! I can't help you with this,' Sora says, mouth curling to one side. 'Besides, it's not like this family stuff has anything to do with me—I'm just some performer.'\nTexas rolls her eyes. She'd finally laid out her whole past to her friends, and now it was nothing more than a harmless joke between them. She shoots a look at Croissant, but the Forte raises her hands as if to say she's all tied up herself. Still, something seems to hit her immediately after, and she pulls something out of a bag and slings it to Texas.\n'Bought it on the way. Think it over nice 'n slow, now—ya got plenty time 'n all.'\nTexas catches it, looks down, and finds it's a box of chocolates.\nHaving said her piece, Croissant heads into the kitchen. She's bought a bumper crop of cookware, and tonight will be her first time flexing her skills in Nuova Volsinii.\nSora switches a new record onto the gramophone. Melodious music fills the new base, while she begins to read the script she has in hand. She's gotten a new job, no doubt.\nExusiai's battle with her forms seems to be nearing a close, and one look at her face tells you she's pretty damn satisfied with what she's accomplished, but Texas knows the next time she fetches her weapons, she's not going to remember a single one of the names she thought up here.\nThis is my life now.\nTexas tears open the packaging, pulls out a stick and begins to slowly chew on it, but the feel of the chocolate as it gradually melts in her mouth, on top of everything she sees and hears and senses right now, leads to a moment of inspiration.\nShe promptly puts pen to form, fills in the name 'Blueberry & Dark Chocolate' a few times before tossing the pen aside.\nExusiai leans in to steal a glance, and bluntly tells her, 'I gotta say, partner, those are <i>really</i> stupid names.'\n'I agree.'

No matter how you slash at it, it never hits back. As a training prop, it's stupidly ineffective, and doesn't fit most training purposes. They should throw anything with that little practical value straight in a trash bin.\nStop laughing. Believe me, inefficiency sickens me more than anyone else sitting here. Yes, I train on a wooden dummy every day, but I've had enough of even seeing it.\nOn the day I first wielded a katana, my first training target was half of a gigantic wooden dummy, taller than I was, so wide I couldn't pick it up. The grounds were covered in snow. They put the dummy dead center, in conditions where your only option for keeping your body temperature up was to brandish your katana as fiercely as you could. The order they gave me was that I wasn't allowed back inside to warm up by the heater until I cut it in half.\nThat day, I shattered six katanas, and cut through eight dummies.\nSince then, practically every day, I've faced off with my katana against dummy after dummy, throwing in the next once I've cut the last one to pieces. I still have the habit today.\nYou're sharp. Yes, it was 'practically' every day, and that's because I did stop once. Not long after I joined Rhodes Island, after participating in my first field mission.\nJust like you, I was hungry for victory on my first mission, but during it we hit an enormous snag. We were facing off against a highly experienced Caster. He was small, and with others covering for him, he was casting Arts like a ghost. We could barely put up a fight against it, and my katana couldn't threaten him in the slightest.\nIt was a painful defeat we swallowed. I was bitter about it as I came back, blaming my blade's helplessness for our loss. So I abandoned my routine, and spent the whole night reviewing recordings and deriving strategies to deal with the Caster's every move. Once I thought I was ready, I stowed away my katana, and took along a huge collection of new weapons to confront the Caster alone.\nBut in the end, I was defeated. It wasn't because my strategies were flawed, or because those new weapons were ineffective on him. It was because I hadn't spent nearly enough time training those strategies or using those weapons. All I did was assume it'd work, watch the recordings a few times, and head off for battle. Reality proved that hopelessly inefficient, and with a large chance of failure.\nAfter I came back, I restored the wooden dummy and began my routine again. It was just a plain dummy, and though I was sick of it, it was able to support me as I drilled my fundamentals and trained newly imagined moves, and that was enough.\nEveryone sitting here is an excellent operator about to take part in their first field mission. As Op Team A4 Captain, I, Yato, warn you all: never stop polishing your skills. That's the one and only path to high efficiency. Acting on assumptions is undesirable. Anything can happen on a fluke, but luck won't always have your back.\nA wooden dummy, a target, a mannequin, anything... smash it to pieces, and never stop. That's what you should be doing.\nAlright, I'm done... anything else?\nOh? You looked up the mission log? That's right, I did take out that Caster in the end.\nI said I failed—I did fail, with those new weapons. In the end, my final plan to settle things was to pull out my katana again, and with the most fleeting of chances, I slashed like I was slashing a dummy.\nAnd I cut that Caster down.

Now, she too is a Very Important Person.\nIt's on the floor directly below Control's, sprawling with all manner of administrative and executive offices. Not that she's at all a stranger to this place, but today, it suddenly hits her that the AC is a little chilly, that her shoes are very loud against the floor, and that the looks the others give her... are harshly incisive.\nShe involuntarily lets out a sigh.\nFrom behind, one of the Defense employees looks at her and sees someone who began worrying for the future of Rhine Lab the moment she assumed her post, and he can't help but feel a level of respect for her.\nAt that precise moment, his terminal rings. It's a notice; he quietly says a few words in response and hangs up.\n'What's going on?'\n'It's nothing. Apparently someone sent something through Engineering's lines. My colleagues are tracing it down; no need for you to worry.'\nIn short order, they arrive at the office. The Defense personnel spend a few seconds operating the door like second nature, then give her the universal handsign for 'go ahead.'\n'Authenticated.

Yes, in front of her, without a doubt, sits one of Mayer's proud works.\nIt's carrying a bag on its back, containing a pouch of coffee beans, a mug, and an accompanying letter.\nShe opens it. It's Mayer's handwriting.\n'Boy have I been wondering what kind of gift to get you. Joyce told me she was gonna go for coffee beans, and eureka! So I remodeled one of my Meeboos a little.\n'You left while I was still working on it, and I was gonna mail it to you, but then Components Control said you'd already had a mountain in your inbox, and just the ETA on inspection was half a month, and I'm not waiting that long, so I borrowed Engineering's lines a little.'\nThere's a knock at the door.\nDammit, thinks Silence.

Oh, wonderful, she got it right.\n'Understood. As long as there's nothing out of the ordinary. Excuse me.'\nSuspicious no longer, the Defense employee turns and leaves.\nShe lets out a third sigh, this time of relief.\nHm. Right, the letter kept going.\n'I already told you at the farewell, but you know, might as well tell you one more time. Congrats on the promotion, Silence!

He had been hiding in a windmill, begging for him to wait for sundown before striking. That way, all the children playing inside his body would have already gone home. He agreed. Two or three hours meant nothing to beings such as them. He sat on a hillside until the sun went down, then returned and slew the whooshing windmill.\nGhosts dwelling in the depths of an ancient tower, books buried beneath the ruins of the Great Library, an unmanned pirate ship, a scale that measures the weight of lives...

'I'm more than glad to take on the responsibility, but I'm worried I'm not qualified to lead.' She confided these thoughts to her teammates.\nOne night, during a combat simulation, Reserve Op Team A1 was completely 'annihilated.' At the time, Fang had discovered a flaw in the opponent's tactics and thought that if she ran fast enough, she could penetrate deep behind enemy lines to split their attention and reduce the suppression fire on Beagle, thus creating more space and time for her team to retaliate. So she changed the strategy on-the-fly and used something her teammates had never practiced. The result: Team wipe. Even Fang was sent to the sickbay for treatment.\n'Why did you push yourself like that?' asked Ace, an elite operator who had taken the time to guide the rookies.\n'Because I'm the captain, so I have to take responsibility for the entire team.'\n'Responsibility, huh...? Responsibility.'\n'Sir, if you were leading the team, what would you have done?'\n'I'd have gone with a safer strategy.'\n'Why?'\n'Don't be hasty. Observe, act, and accumulate experience. That's what I always do.'\n'But you're already an elite capable of leading entire squads.'\n'Which is why I know full well that, on the battlefield, a commander only has one chance to bear full responsibility.' The man falls silent for a moment. ' So we ought to use it wisely.'\n'I don't quite understand, but I'll try to keep that in mind.' Fang continued, 'So please teach me to be a better captain! I'll commit to it, no matter how much work it takes!'\n'Let's continue this conversation once you've recovered from your injuries, young captain.' Ace waved goodbye before leaving.\nFollowing this incident, Fang indeed underwent rigorous training. When all was said and done, Ace handed her a box and told her this: 'For a captain, the most important thing is to remain calm and collected. Your long-term training task is learning to be patient. And your reward for that is here in this box.'\nAs for what happened next...\nFang snaps back to reality and re-evaluates her current status. On the day she became an official operator, she felt she wasn't ready. On the day she received her second promotion, she still felt she wasn't ready. Now, she is about to head to Londinium to support the operators there. She has been through dozens of operations, some easy, some dangerous. Some short, some long.

The girl inside takes notice.\nShe lifts her head in an attempt to catch Kal'tsit's gaze. However, stacks of files sprawled across the conference table obscures most of her face, revealing only the tips of a pair of fluffy ears.\n'The leader of the Leithanian convoy did not object to our terms.' Kal'tsit listens as she moves towards the girl, gathering the scattered files. 'That doesn't mean they'll agree to all of them.'\n'Right. While they were polite during the negotiations, the way they looked at me felt... cold and menacing.' The girl winces, as if still feeling the sting of their sugar-coated animosity.\n'Try not to—'\n'—be influenced by the emotions of others, especially their negative ones. I understand.' The girl's smile is reassuring. 'Don't worry. I've already put them under the surveillance of Mantra's squad. Logos assured me that if they harbored any ill intentions towards Rhodes Island, their hands would be frozen to their staffs before they could even cast.'\nLogos likely tempered his rhetoric when describing the devastating effects of his Arts to protect this young girl. It has become a common practice among the Operators, who adjust to her leadership while subconsciously taking her as a child who needs protection. Yet anyone who assumes that eleven-year-old Amiya needs protection is soon taken aback by her shrewdness and meticulous nature.\nYoung Amiya is growing quickly. She has already outgrown her bespoke dress from three months ago, and the rate at which her mind expands is even more remarkable. There were times when Kal'tsit felt that each day, the Amiya she saw was slightly different from the day before. She wasn't sure if it was merely a hallucination or if the influence of Civilight Eterna on Amiya hadn't been completely subdued.\n'Dr. Kal'tsit...' Amiya's voice softened, like a pin dropping in a silent room. 'I've been dreaming again.'\n'What did you dream about?'\n'I dreamed of... a person. She sat next to me, held my hand, and spoke of many things. Some were from my past, while others seemed like experiences yet to come.'\n'The future?'\n'Umm... Maybe. She told me that in a massive nomadic city with steel high walls, a terrible war will break out. Many, especially the Sarkaz, will perish, and black rocks will spread everywhere.'\n'And as she spoke of these things, she was...'\n'She was so very upset, but she was strong and didn't keep crying. She said she would never give up and that the future would become better.'\nKal'tsit extends her hand to the little girl. In the past year, the deceased have not been a topic commonly discussed. Perhaps Amiya still needed comfort to cope with her losses.\n'Amiya, it is only natural to miss those we've lost. You need not suppress your feelings for Theresa.'\n'Well... I do miss Theresa a whole lot, but it wasn't her in my dream.' Amiya's eyes widen. 'Dr. Kal'tsit, I think... the person in my dream was me.'\nKal'tsit is slightly taken aback by this revelation, but before she can respond, Amiya has already rushed forward and embraced her.\n'All this talking has made me hungry.' The young girl shakes Kal'tsit's hands, her eyes shining with a precious look. She begins to drag Kal'tsit along, her voice bubbling with excitement. 'Dr. Kal'tsit, won't you keep me company?'\n'What should we get? Baked beans sound nice. Mr. Scout said that adding carrots would make them sweeter...'\n'Brr... Ursus sure is cold.

So, she has made herself a rule too: before eight, finish everything she has to finish, and kill everyone she has to kill.\nBut she hasn't finish her job today. The enemy's had more forces hidden than the Saluzzos expected, and things are getting bogged down.\nHer guys have the ride home ready. She knows her father doesn't give a shit about her results, just that she's punctual.\nSo she chooses to get on. But the enemy choose this moment to loose a pack of trained tuskbeasts, a handful of which breach the vicinity, and charge straight aboard the wheels, aimed straight for her throat.\nThey can't get near her, of course; she dodges easily, and decapitates them in the same motion. Still, something tells her they slashed <i>something</i> on her.\nShe looks down. It was the pocket watch.

这件小东西已经有一百五十多岁了。来自多伦郡的收藏家囊中告急，否则也不会以如此低廉的价格与我交易。也正是在那个幸运的雨夜，我遇到了一位特殊的客人，他披着黑色斗篷，操着维多利亚西北部的特有口音，向我询问我手上金币的来历。上了年纪之后，闲言碎语总比正题更容易脱口而出，我本以为像他这样的年轻人一定会打断我漫长的开场白，但他却听得津津有味。我兴致越发高昂，于是告诉他我对于金币上特殊印记的解读。临走前，他说，如果再发现带有相似印记的藏品，请一定要通知他，然后他如影子一般消失在伦蒂尼姆的雨中。\n之后我与这位神秘的先生保持着断断续续的交往，即使收到消息后他不能立刻光顾这间破旧的小店，也一定会择日上门，听我讲述我与这些藏品相遇的故事以及原主人的经历。久而久之，我对他在追寻的事物产生了好奇。在拜访了几个老家伙之后，我得知这枚印记与某种远古的戏剧崇拜有关。想起那位客人总在深夜到访，装束又如此神秘，我不禁产生了一丝担忧。不过，或许是我一生都未经历过传奇因而心驰神往，又或许是他沉默但慷慨的姿态总能打消我的顾虑，我们依旧保持着良好的交易关系。我能看出这位先生迫切地想要收集有关双生相印的信息，但他光临时依旧会认真端详小店中的其他藏品，翻看纸张松脆的老剧本，欣赏墙上新收来的古董油画。艺术对他来说似乎有一种天然的吸引力。某次见面时，他的口袋中掉出了一张票根，我这才知道原来他是云游剧团的演员。当我提出想去观赏他的表演时，他摇了摇头，说自己再也不会演出了。他离开后，我翻转票根发现了熟悉的印记......太可惜了，我猜测他是一名好演员。\n距我与卢西恩先生第一次相遇已过去了八年，近几年他不再登门，我也越来越老了。今晚又是一个雨夜，意料之外地，我熟悉又陌生的客人再次光临。他的装束与之前截然不同，眉宇间的神色也发生了变化。我发了一会儿愣，随后像往常一样问他，先生你需要什么。他未作回答，只是从袖中拿出了一枚崭新的金叶，上面刻着我们心照不宣的印记。叶片在蒙着灰尘的小店里泛着动人的、新生般的光泽。我想接过这枚漂亮的赠礼，把它放在店里最显眼的位置，而那位先生只是将它随手放在最近的橱柜之上，就像作家在字里行间留下一个句点，等待来者的追问和解读。在讲述了几十个关于印记的故事之后，我也已经成为故事的一部分。\n太好了，他终于解开了自己的谜题。\n我想我再也不会见到他了。","name":"酒神之心","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30165","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30115","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_1043_leizi2":{"cnOnly":true,"name":"Leizi

'You can't keep using your Originium Arts like that.' The advice she got from her tribespeople years ago echoes in her ear. 'Your body can't withstand it anymore. You'll fall ill if you keep casting them.'\nNonetheless, she has pushed herself to her limits in the tundra more times than she can count. With the responsibilities she shoulders, she's never been one to fear falling ill.\nSome time later, she faintly overhears two men talking in hushed voices.\n'Shh—It's okay.

It's a month in Londinium where rain comes every evening. Not too badly; it's a fine drizzle, nothing that inconveniences anyone rushing home from work, but it stirs the scent of the ground into the air. Rotting wood, the rankling smell of fins, and needless to say, sweat. The Borough of Norbert never smells much like a part of Londinium. All the bigger logistics warehouses have relocated to the north side, and the factories and markets have gone with, leaving behind a plate full of refuse no other borough wants, and the people with nowhere else to go.\nA shout comes from the boxing gym downstairs—sounds like Indra's won again. It's a night of celebration for the Glasgow Gang. Vina led the lot charging into the underground casino on Mariner Road this afternoon, and scared the Ronnie brothers right out of Norport wholesale. After that, the buildings surrounding were all Glasgow's. Morgan got all worked up and hefted barrels of booze over—needed to celebrate properly, according to her. Said she got this stuff from that top fancy pub on the corner, paid loads for it. Got Baird worried she'd been taken in. With enough drink down them, the lot all paraded up arm in arm and chanted her name, 'Siege,' so loud the whole street could hear.\nHow much of a conqueror does subduing a few gangs really make you? When she first got that name, Vina honestly could've laughed or died of embarrassment, maybe both. None of Indra's lot knew her background, and she wasn't even hiding it on purpose, she just never found the right time to share all. Norbert and Auchterigg were like two different countries—no one cared whose parents were who here. The most was the one time, when the police got hold of some Glasgow and brought them into the station. It was routine questioning from the coppers—what race was she? She stared that officer beaming from ear to ear dead in the eye, and on some ridiculous impulse, answered 'Aslan.' That threw him for a loop, and then he had her by the scruff, trying to tug her head into the table. Vina sat calm, didn't bend her neck one bit. Oh, he turned red. His hands shook and shook, as tends to happen on a diet of grease and drink, until he finally turned from trying violence to harsh words instead. Threatened her saying she wouldn't step out of this station for the rest of the month talking daft shit like that, the piddling hoodlum she was. She was out the next day. Morgan and Indra fetched her there, Indra telling her how she sent a Baron's boys running for the hills with a Molotov, Morgan saying she had to mediate like crazy, and it cost a pretty penny. Past the street corner, Vina couldn't help but take a look back. Absolutely nothing there watching her, no people nor giant creatures. That flash of gold must've just been the sun blinding her eyes.\nVina couldn't tell you how long she's gone without seeing Gawain now. Her teacher might well be everywhere at once. At a fried fin stand, mingling in the boxing gym, maybe up in the clouds above. Could be anywhere. The moment that occurs to her, something makes her twitch for no reason at all, and unconsciously, she goes to reach for another bitter lollipop to stick in her mouth. But once she does, she finds the metal box emptied. Completely vacant and light as a feather. Somehow, someway, her heart feels just as airy, like she's losing her balance. She'd better find something heavier to shove in there next time, Vina thinks. Wouldn't go wrong with some rivets from the construction site.\nSomewhere behind, Baird calls for her. Shoving her candy box back in her trouser pocket, Vina grins a little and turns around, sauntering back over to the clamor of voices that was, is, and will be Siege's.","name":"'Candy Box'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30135","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30115","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_siege","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"SOL","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_siege","description":"Gawain ambles through the city. He's spent so much time in this manner, yet still can't say he's used to seeing what he sees. Londinium's clouds are hanging low as ever—when did that start happening? He strains to recall, but can't come up with a definite answer. As if the last time he looked to the sky, the gloomy haze was never even there.\nAlexandrina Vina Victoria lies sleeping on the counter in the pub. Yesterday, she and her companions made an all-too-tough escape from the beat. It strikes Gawain that she especially resembles her grandmother in these moments—or was it her great-grandmother? The one named Mathilda, the girl with a head of gold curls, how exactly was she related to Vina here? Face after face flashes by, going from young to old, ultimately scattering with the sand on the wind. Some of those faces might not even actually exist, being simply products of vaguer parts of the mind. Gawain has to admit, his time spent by this family's side may be longer than he was anticipating at first. Far longer already.\nHe doesn't make a habit of appearing before people. The interpretations of him as a symbol of power disgust him, and hardly fall in line with his original agreement. Still, their ups and downs have kept Gawain watching with interest all the same. There'll be times he can't help but reflect on history. Moments where shadows of similarity loom over them.\nVina once asked him why her teacher would always be by her side, and at the time his answer was silence. Yes, he learned long ago not to meddle anymore, because farewell would always come eventually. He still dimly remembers how, once, he and Lugalszargus bounded about that battlefield they call the foehn hotlands these days. He carried that mettlesome man atop his back, and with the Nightzmoran Khagan by their side, they charged for the sandstorms of afar. Everyone died there—and that was the news he brought back to Lugalszargus's daughter. He remembers the feeling of his mane wet with tears. Those times proved... to pass in the twinkling of an eye. Humanity is far frailer than a master of the beasts, and the years have taught him that fact again and again.\nSome bygones aren't worth dredging up so often, and Gawain only recalls those periods very, very occasionally in his dreams. A meeting so old that history had not yet been written, a reckless boy upon the barrens who never feared him one bit. Their travels together, cheers and tears, song and wine, and then—his age, his death. That was the first time, not as a sovereign, but as a friend, that Gawain witnessed death. Warmth fading from flesh, breath stilling from mouth and nose.

She thinks to dig out some winter bamboo shoots to stave off her hunger, to take a few mouthfuls of snow to allay her thirst.\nThe bamboo forest is a fine place to hide, but she's not the only one who knows that. A dozen or so shinobi are in cover here, tasked with ensuring that this girl, the last survivor to escape from the purge of her family, does not remain so.\nThe bamboo leaves rustle, and the branches up high drift up and down in the wind.\nTheir tips shudder, shaking free small clumps of snow, which scatter in a slicing gust before they ever touch the ground, becoming a fine wintry mist and disappearing into the air. A few fowlbeasts on another stalk retract their necks, stuck out moments prior, and fold their wings up again, relaxing and continuing to huddle close.\nAll is still.\nThe bony girl lifts her head.\nSuddenly, a white glint.\nA dart at odds with her build flies from her hand, snowflakes and wind whirling alongside. This weapon has seen plenty of use thus far; now, it makes a clean cut yet smashes to pieces a bamboo leaf big enough to conceal someone.\nThe struck shinobi lets out a short cry, and powdery snow explodes off the layers of leaves. A trap prepared long in advance cuts off the girl's retreat. She leaps atop a branch, before being forced back by the flash of a descending blade. Her weakness from days without food catching up to her, she loses her grip on the branch, and drops like a stone. But undeterred, she looses one final arrow from her sleeve in midair.\nIt finds itself with no target to hit, but both her and the shinobi crash to the ground at practically the same time, with a dull thud. She lifts her head, and before her is a Lung dressed in black, brandishing a naginata right behind the shinobi.\n'So this is where you were, girl?'\nThe girl stares blankly, not knowing how to respond.\n'I am Fumizuki,' she says, patting the girl's head. 'Can you use a blade?'\nThe girl comes to her senses, and nods. She grasps a handful of snow from the ground, stuffs it in her mouth and swallows, draws a spare tantou from Fumizuki's waist, and charges at her enemy within the forest. Fumizuki watches this frail girl leave, and quickly follows behind.\nOne, then two. From sun overhead to horizon-laid, the shadows amidst the bamboo fall without even a chance to signal their backup. When the final shinobi uses the last of their strength to charge the girl, aiming a hidden shot straight at her stomach, Fumizuki pushes her down to avoid this fatal blow.\nOnce it's all over, a tiny body collapses in the great bamboo thicket, holding her wounds and letting out a long, slow breath.\nSunshine's rays filter through the leaves and shine on her face, the sound of fowlbeasts flapping by in her ears.\nBefore exhaustion brings her to sleep, her parents' lifelong teachings come back to her. The girl must offer her loyalty to the princess before her.","name":"Shuriken","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"31023","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":20000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":15},{"id":"30053","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":25000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":5},{"id":"31043","count":6},{"id":"4001","count":30000}]]}]},"char_120_hibisc":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Hibiscus","profession":"Medic","rarity":"TIER_3","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":1}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30031","count":1}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30042","count":1}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30052","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30023","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30033","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":40,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":55,"evolveCost":[]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_heal_up[1]","icon":"skcom_heal_up[1]","name":"Healing Up α","masteryCosts":[]}],"modules":[]},"char_121_lava":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Lava","profession":"Caster","rarity":"TIER_3","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":1}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30021","count":1}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30032","count":1}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30042","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30013","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30023","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":40,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":55,"evolveCost":[]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_magic_rage[1]","icon":"skcom_magic_rage[1]","name":"Tactical Chant α","masteryCosts":[]}],"modules":[]},"char_122_beagle":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Beagle","profession":"Defender","rarity":"TIER_3","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":1}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30051","count":1}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30062","count":1}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30012","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30083","count":1}],[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30093","count":1}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":40,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":55,"evolveCost":[]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_def_up[1]","icon":"skcom_def_up[1]","name":"DEF Up α","masteryCosts":[]}],"modules":[]},"char_123_fang":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Fang","profession":"Vanguard","rarity":"TIER_3","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":1}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30011","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30022","count":1}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30032","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30043","count":1}],[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30053","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":40,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":55,"evolveCost":[]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_charge_cost[1]","icon":"skcom_charge_cost[1]","name":"Charge α","masteryCosts":[]}],"modules":[]},"char_124_kroos":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Kroos","profession":"Sniper","rarity":"TIER_3","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":1}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30061","count":1}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30012","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30022","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30093","count":1}],[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30103","count":1}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":40,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":55,"evolveCost":[]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_kroos_1","icon":"skchr_kroos_1","name":"Double Tap - Auto","masteryCosts":[]}],"modules":[]},"char_126_shotst":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Meteor","profession":"Sniper","rarity":"TIER_4","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":2}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30041","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30052","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30062","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30083","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":45,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":60,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3241","count":3},{"id":"30042","count":1},{"id":"30062","count":1}]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3242","count":5},{"id":"30043","count":14},{"id":"30033","count":12}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_shotst_1","icon":"skchr_shotst_1","name":"Armor Breaker","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30094","count":1},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":2},{"id":"30094","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"30064","count":2}]]},{"id":"skchr_shotst_2","icon":"skchr_shotst_2","name":"Armor Breaker - Spread","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30104","count":1},{"id":"30083","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30024","count":2},{"id":"30104","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30125","count":2},{"id":"30044","count":2}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_shotst","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"MAR","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_shotst","description":"Coming in at a clip through the dense forest hills, her heart pounds like it wants to leap from her chest.

Calm down, calm down.'\nHeeding her warm caress, the prey's struggles slowly cease, and it stares at her with its deep black gaze. In the pool of its stagnant eye, its pupil still tremors and quakes, stirring a whirlpool in its sclera, tenaciously seeking to draw one last drop of mercy from the two eyes staring back.\nYet her voice is a ruthless gust that coils through dead leaves.\n'It'll all be over soon.'\nWith a draw of a hunter's knife from her rear hip, slitting the prey's throat is both quick and clean. Fresh blood gushes from the incision and stains the earth, leaving behind a thick iron stench which mixes with the rotting autumn leaves and lingers for a good while in her nose.\nThis month shows signs of spring, winter having only just thawed, and the ice-littered creeks chill her fingers to a deep red swell while the blood hardened on the knife washes and melts away in the current. Like red threads needling through the water, flowing with the creek to the forest's edge.\nBehind her, a full beastskin hangs on a branch, with a bonfire lit below to cook the moisture from it. The prey's carcass has been split, one half skewered above the fire, wafting an enticing aroma of grease as it roasts. The other half she's left by the creek, soon to be found by scavenging animals following the scent of blood, and dragged away in their mouths.\nDaytime follows in the departing footsteps of night, early morn filtering through the forest in slanted beams from the east. Perfectly pale light glances again and again off the creek's shimmering waves, stabbing at her undefended eyes still adjusted to the earlier darkness. Her hand quickly shields them as she waits for them to adapt to the sun's sting. Warmth takes to the fine veins in her eyelids, inviting her to open her eyes again and see the beautiful sight. Letting out a deep sigh, she experimentally opens her tightly curled fingers. Her eyelashes tremble, she opens her eyes, and that which filters through the cracks between her fingers is the faint green of a rich forest. Deep in the trees, a kyebeast wanders through the cover, chewing leisurely at the grass, unaware that it's already been trapped in that frigid forest, and of the keen arrow nocked in a bow aimed at the hollow of its throat.","name":"Hunter's Knife","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"30083","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":20000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":15},{"id":"30093","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":25000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":5},{"id":"31023","count":6},{"id":"4001","count":30000}]]}]},"char_127_estell":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Estelle","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_4","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":2}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30041","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30052","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30062","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30033","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30043","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":45,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":60,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":3},{"id":"30042","count":1},{"id":"30052","count":1}]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3222","count":5},{"id":"30103","count":12},{"id":"30093","count":8}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_atk_up[2]","icon":"skcom_atk_up[2]","name":"ATK Up β","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30054","count":1},{"id":"30033","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":2},{"id":"30054","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"30104","count":2}]]},{"id":"skchr_estell_2","icon":"skchr_estell_2","name":"Sacrificial Strike","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30064","count":1},{"id":"30043","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30084","count":2},{"id":"30064","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30125","count":2},{"id":"30024","count":2}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_estell","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"CEN","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_estell","description":"'Look at the girl in this photo. Memorize her appearance,' Danny Chip told Rustcage. 'If someone comes to your doorstep with a girl like this, look after her for me.'\nThe careworker at Lloyd Russet Biolaboratories often used to speak with pride, lips pried lightly by alcohol, of how their company had stolen rainforests and headwaters away from the aboriginals that survived on them. Of how amidst crop failure they'd bought the requisite Archosauria children for just twelve gold bonds and a handful of food. He would speak, too, of how those children priced at just twelve bonds would be remodeled into replicas of the 'Archosauria War-God.' At the end of the story, they would defeat their competitors, receive orders from the military, and then come home like kings...\nHalf a year later, the passionate egghead was reduced to a drunkard passing each night with a bottle, always grumbling in despair of the chaos of the experiments: an escaped fowl during Phase II of animal testing, the complete failures of Phases I and II of human testing, all the test subjects destroyed... then ultimately, Subject 75, the most abnormal individual in all the Phase IV human tests.\nSubject 75 was not just devoid of two horns; her personality lacked any resemblance to a weapon of war. Even after provoking her by all proven means, driving her to her last gasp, she showed no hint of the 'War-God' essence at all. Bizarrely, as a failed article, 75 was only a momentary frustration to the careworker. Very quickly, he ceased to drown himself in drink, and began to happily chat with her about daily life, about his wonderful future with Careworker Celina, about how they'd raise a girl that loved princess stories, and go on vacation to Siesta together... A failure, yet one that guided this lost soul back home.\nHowever, all the 'successful' Phase IV subjects suddenly and collectively went out of control during obedience training one day, leading to the deaths of several experiment personnel. As was standard procedure, they had to 'humanely' destroy the subjects of this phase. That evening, Danny came to Rustcage's saloon, and handed him the photograph of Subject 75.\nIn the end, neither Danny nor the girl ever visited that saloon again.\nThe lab later officially declared that Danny had, along with fellow careworker Celina, 'lost their lives together' in the incident.\nSix years later, the noisy saloon patrons have turned into wild hunters, exchanging the saloon's fine dining for the taste of fresh sport... What was once an establishment in the wake of the Great Expansion now exists in solidarity with the Oripathy-blighted and the Pioneers that same wake had cast out unto the dried-up earth. Not even the biolab was spared, resting marooned upon loose rock.\nAt this moment, Rustcage stares at the girl not far away, then looks down to compare the photograph in his hands. He doesn't know why she's grown two big horns, but there's no doubt they're one and the same.\nHe sees the hunt wild and unadulterated, sees the food chain built around her. He sees civilization's mark gradually fading, and the wilderness baring her original face—despite her heavy infection he knows he stands no chance.\nFinally, Rustcage sets down his hunter's crossbow. With the last of his strength, he delivers to her his hoard of oh so many years, these farewell gifts from the wilds.","name":"Farewell Gifts from the Wildlands","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"31013","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":20000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":15},{"id":"30063","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":25000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":5},{"id":"30073","count":6},{"id":"4001","count":30000}]]}]},"char_128_plosis":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Ptilopsis","profession":"Medic","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30011","count":10}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30043","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30053","count":2},{"id":"30073","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3261","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3263","count":3},{"id":"30014","count":9},{"id":"30093","count":10}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_heal_up[3]","icon":"skcom_heal_up[3]","name":"Healing Up γ","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30064","count":2},{"id":"30043","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"30064","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30024","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_plosis_2","icon":"skchr_plosis_2","name":"Enkephalin","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"30053","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30074","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_plosis","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"RIN","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_plosis","description":"'If Originium really has the ability to store information, and we are able to decode and translate it, then Columbia's science and technology will surge forward by leaps and bounds!' \n'I've encountered a bottleneck.

These past few days, dinner hours have ended with numerous operators unwilling to leave, sitting at already cleared-out tables looking around in anticipation of that day's confections.\nAn operator who wishes to remain unnamed (and is not a Lateran) confesses to us: 'I didn't believe them at first, when they said off-menu desserts kept showing up in the canteen recently. Then last night, my very idea of desserts got completely upended.'\nWe only half-believed it ourselves when we squeezed into the dessert section and pulled out what looked like an extremely ordinary 'lemon' from amidst the cakes. Not normally eaten whole, we cut the fruit open and got the familiar lemony scent, and even saw its glistening juices flow out from the cut. However, once we tasted the tart-yet-sweet, faintly milk-flavored layers of cake that made up the 'pulp' inside, like the other operators we were blown away by the chef's ingenuity and maestro-level craft.\nWe attempted to interview the few operators that typically make their way in and out of the cafeteria kitchen, but all of them smiled and refused to answer our questions. In the end, with Operator Ceobe serving as an avenue for our breakthrough, we finally obtained enough leads to discover the maker... no, the artist of these desserts.\nWe found the operator in question at the Medical Department. She was busy at the time, and could not spare us an interview.\nAs Operator Honeyberry (who just so happened to be free) informed us, the chef has recently been busy assisting Medical with developing pharmaceuticals more appealing to children.\nA significant number of child patients are aboard Rhodes Island, and the question of how to improve their compliance in taking medication has always vexed our medics. Many children instinctively make a show of resistance when faced with liquid or tablet doses that they hate the taste of. The vast majority of Medic operators can imagine that the simple addition of sugar wouldn't rid a drug of its strange flavor.\nAs of now, though, Medical has developed several successful formulations with this operator's help. Making use of her precise grasp on flavor and color, she's not only been able to conceal the uniquely offputting taste of these drugs, but has taken full advantage of the opportunity, using these medical flavors as a base to create aromas that make your mouth water.

Every time she meets her sister, Astgenne wants to yank her over to the dorms, so they can complete the gift she gave her together.\nBut she blinks, and deadline for her thesis, and the requisites for her defense, and the pressure of her projects all loom, sucking away all her spare time. Every time she thinks of it, the crush of reality suppresses her urge.\nSome desires are untempered by time, but life and work are more than capable of postponing the realization of a wish, indefinitely\n.......\nOwing to some circumstances, she's now been sent out by Rhine Lab and become a Rhodes Island Operator. Her Rhine Lab colleagues helped her pack everything, and she now stands in her brand new vacuum of a room, unpacking that minor mountain of personal belongings and experimental equipment, bit by bit.\nShe finds a box laden with dust, and those dolts back at the lab didn't even pack her a dusting cloth. With no better option, she sounds the bell on the dorm room next door, first to say hi to her new neighbor, and second to borrow a rag to wipe off the dust.\nThe door opens.\nAnd there's Astesia, who stuffs clean wet wipes and an all-purpose toolbox into her dumbstruck little sister's hands.\n......\nOne wonders if perhaps, after the sisters have finished sorting out the room, that's the sound of a clock we can hear.","name":"Unassembled Clock","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31034","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31044","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_136_hsguma":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Hoshiguma","profession":"Defender","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30031","count":6},{"id":"30041","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30032","count":4},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30103","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30013","count":5},{"id":"30063","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3231","count":5},{"id":"30012","count":11},{"id":"30042","count":5}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3233","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30094","count":5}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_hsguma_1","icon":"skchr_hsguma_1","name":"Warpath","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30024","count":4},{"id":"30103","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"30034","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_hsguma_2","icon":"skchr_hsguma_2","name":"Thorns","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30034","count":4},{"id":"30013","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30034","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_hsguma_3","icon":"skchr_hsguma_3","name":"Saw of Strength","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"30023","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30074","count":4},{"id":"30054","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"30074","count":7}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_hsguma","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"PRO","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_hsguma","description":"■■ Day, ■■ Month\nI got this shield from him.

From here on, it's my partner.\n\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nBefore I left, Hannya's good old 'father' said he had something else to give me. I thought it'd be something important, but it was just a hunk of scrap metal.\nHe said any handle paired with Hannya, I'd need to polish myself. It's a strange ask, but if that's part of the craft, it's not like I can't do it. Hannya already has a front that terrifies people, and an edge sharp enough to chop through enemies, so me personally making an inside to match might be the proper way.\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nApparently, I've got to polish this to the point I can fight holding Hannya barehanded without chafing my hands, or feeling any sort of discomfort.\nAs in, I've just got to polish all the edges flat?\nAlright, looks like this is going to be a very long process.\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nI feel like I've been polishing for long enough, but it still chafes.\nIt looks smooth and flat already. Is this still not enough?\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nIt's been... some time since I left Higashi. Lungmen's a complex place. There's good parts, and bad parts. I've taught lessons to plenty who needed them, and run across plenty of interesting folk. I think I like it here.\nThere's no part of Hannya's handle for me to polish any further. After using it so long, even the curve's run flat. But it's still a metal block in the end, and no matter what, it won't reach the point where people can use it without any discomfort. It seems like it was all an impossible task from the beginning.\nI guess my craft isn't perfected enough. Even if I force myself to polish all the edges flat, it still can't hide itself. An iron chunk's an iron chunk, and it won't get any softer. Even if it looks smooth and slick, its nature won't change.\nAs of today, I think I've understood his intent a little.\n\n■■ Day, ■■ Month\nI got this gift from my friends.\nMaybe it's bad of me to say this, but I definitely didn't expect those two ladies to put so much care into thinking up a suitable present for me.

He can scarcely believe his eyes.\n'No one told me anything about this!' he shrieked. 'Why the hell are they doing this in the city? That's not how this is supposed to work!'\n'It's the pursuit of wealth. Not uncommon.'\nThe towering Oni lady who responds leans behind a metal barrel, her posture somehow relaxed, but her hand never leaving her shield.\nThere's a momentary break in the commotion.\nHoshiguma takes a peek out. The other end is pitch black, and she knows danger hides in the dark.\nThe L.G.D.'s reinforcements are still out in the street, hemmed by a group of runaways who've broken the rules, their attack primed and imminent.\nThe situation is, in essence, a total crapshoot, and they can only wait for a chance to break the encirclement.\nAh Hsiang's face is grave. He was a street youth, no stranger to the downtown. He'd scraped through life for some years in every corner of the city, just a nameless nobody, but at least he had a talent for making it, or so he'd profess.\nNow he was an informant for the L.G.D., and at a glance much steadier on his feet. No need to lie—Hoshiguma was happy for that.\nIt's hard to tell who brought up the conversation up first.\n'How's everyone else been?'\n'Pretty good. Ah Sam's family found him a job. Daai Tau's running a bar now. I remember he was counting on you for the official stuff, Madame Oni.'\n'That's right. You? Haven't been back home all these years?'\n'No, too busy. Wouldn't work out.'\n'How's your family doing, then?'\n'Living on pensions. Not much, but they get by.'\n'That's good. Stable.'\n'You, Madame Oni?'\n'I'm cruising. If it's enough, it's enough for me.'\nAh Hsiang doesn't say any more. Neither does Hoshiguma.\nThe weather is gloomy, and it rained not long ago.\nFilthy, strangely-tinted water leaks out from the pile of trash bags next to them, trickling out near their feet and straight into a drain not far away.\nA rustling gradually abates. The calmer it gets, the more his nerves stretch.\nAt that moment, Ah Hsiang suddenly becomes talkative.\n'You afraid, Madame Oni?'\nHe asks, but he also keeps going. 'I only agreed to pitch in for the L.G.D. this time because you were here.'\n'There was that one time they said we could go out with knives to spook that shop guy for trying to snatch up business, and we'd get lai see for it. You still remember that, Madame Oni?'\nHoshiguma stares at the alley entrance, unnodding.\nShe remembers coming across those youngsters a few years ago. They were trash, dumped out onto the street, seen as scum unfit for society. They lived muddied lives, liable to drop dead for no reason, at any time.\nSo when Wei Yenwu invited her to join the L.G.D., Hoshiguma spent a whole night thinking, and then nodded to agree.\nShe believes there'll be change in Lungmen.\n'If you didn't stop me back then, I would've gone with them.'\nThe voice behind her trembles.\n'I heard, later, they actually killed someone, and they all got thrown in.\n'And there was the other time, those mafia guys from outside came giving us trouble, and in the end it was you who held them off too.'\nHis throat constricts, his teeth chatter, and his voice seems to falter somewhat.\n'I've been thinking. My family's toughing it a little, going on nothing but pension after all.\n'I bet you'd have an easy time charging out there if you wanted. If I wasn't here.\n'I took out insurance on myself, you know. I'm sorted.\n'So, Madame Oni, don't worry about me—'\n\nClank. \n\nA sudden brittle noise.\nLike some kind of signal, the L.G.D. Inspector rises like a sheer mountain, and breaks her silence with a roar of fury.\nAll hell breaks loose within that shortest of moments, set to the sound of trash being trampled, and piles of barrels being knocked over, and crossbows slicing the air, and—\nHefty crashes of metal.\nAn unblocked bolt pierces the Lungmen Guard Department Inspector's badge Hoshiguma has set on her chest, but it doesn't stop her shield sweeping through every foe as she stands in front of the one she's meant to protect, not one step forward, not one step back.\nHoshiguma once again lifts her shield, swallows a mouthful of blood back down, and coughs twice before finally saying something.\n'Not worrying about you'll be a little difficult.'\nShe wipes a bloodstain from the corner of her mouth, voice as though choking on water.

The weapon granted the king an aura of gravitas that permeated the land, and the king never had to wield it against any enemy throughout his entire life.\nHe once wished to demonstrate his loyalty to Signora Sicilia like the others, yet was rejected nonchalantly. It was then he came to understand how she ruled this country replete with violence, as well as the weariness and helplessness she hid.\nBut now, he had no idea what sort of fangs this strange young wolf should bear.\nAn exquisite rapier, because she would inherit her father's eccentricity and elusiveness?\nA deadly great-axe, because she could not ignore the call of the wild in her blood?\nNo, neither would suffice.

Between the bars of naked steel she skips, from one end of the alleyway to the other, and on top of a faded billboard she climbs. Not far away, an empty tin can topples over. She takes a small step back, crouching for a while under the shadow. Only once she's sure her silhouette is alone again under the moonlight—does her step pick up once again, deft like a wisp of fog. She finds her way straight through a window empty of its glass.\nA puddle of water rests on the ground, which she avoids with great intent. Probably the recent shower of rain, that tonight's so especially bright. Not a good omen, in any case. In times gone by, no one would dare trespass into the Forest thick of fog, for there was Witch's domain. The greedy merchant had want of the Witch's powers, but pitch-black smoke would bind the neck of such a soul. Only lost children would have good fortune in the night... Most of the coven had come to suffer a different kind of curse already, but in the hazy night those inauspicious stones would happily be hidden from view.\nA great fire of yore took the original Witch Forest. Thereafter, one nomadic city to the next, these empty rooms have been little more than the cracks amidst neon and skyscraper's reflections... hardly fit for a safe domain.\nShe silently patrols her temporary lodgings, and finds the Hat out of a pile of miscellanies. A broad-brimmed one, cloth heavy-set in all its layers. Its inside is riddled with patchwork, every hand which sewed on those eclectic fabrics still there in her memories. Some were wizened, some young, all so soft without exception, so tender. She jumps into it, lets the sheets of fabric surround her body, as if she's returned to their embrace.\nAnother hand rests upon her head. She remembers this one, the youngest among them, and the last to still follow her. This girl's hand once carried the scent of clean grass and fresh paper, like the others, but in these times it was always sullied with rust, with blood.\n'We've been found again.'

They tend to her body, attempt to heal her rended ego—they would not bestow her such a vile gift as this.\nShe touches the candlelight, but the fingertip feels no hint of warmth. A momentary lucidity and tranquility race ashore like foam. The edges of the waves wash over her throat cut wide open, and zealotry, scorched sun-dry in darkness, extinguishes its bellows. In the same moment, white flame climbs her wrist, sets her nun's habit alight, and leaps from her shoulder to sink into her sweeping hair.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. Laurentina stands before a statue. The Stygian sea encases a dome teeming with lights. The figure freed from raw stone lingers in her eyes, and its shadow chisels out an alcove. There, Laurentina lifts a machine to cut stone, a 'Little Handy' roving in circles beside her, swallowing up the fragments that pitter-patter against the floor.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. Rallying cries. Piercing whistles and sawblades all around as far as the eye can see, gristle and blood peeled from body, bones met together and fractured apart. The hunters born beneath domes are tearing apart the barriers of flesh now before them, their enemies falling to the seafloor as raindrops to the surface. A lance severs open a cavity; an incisive and clarion order; amidst ocean's currents Laurentina charges in. She hears singing.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. The statue behind the candle holder is virgin holy white, and when it weeps, it casts a shadow. She is sliced apart, to then be mended; sliced apart again, to then be mended again. Finally, they use Specter to slice apart Laurentina, and allow the seeds of dry land to root within her body. Thus, the sister kneels before the candle holder, grips her pendant tight, recites prayer from her heart, liturgical meanings discerned by none.\nThrough the candlelight, she looks within. The door to the treatment ward is pulled open. A familiar scent. A lithe yet firm echo of footsteps strikes down the candle holder, melting it into the lights of the corridor.

She had no desire in her to learn, or to give it any trial and error.

She even got a small fluffy ball, stuffed in her knapsack, that she can hold in her hand when there's no Lupo's tail to stroke, letting her feel fur brushing past her fingertips. \nBut how long is she going to stay here? \nKal'tsit didn't say. \nBut she's ultimately unable to adapt to this tremendous maze, and the wilds stopped needing her long ago. \nSo, is she going to leave? \nShe doesn't know. \n\nThe dagger she knows lies deep in her knapsack, letting out a minute hum, just like a whimper.","name":"Mystery Prop Pack","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31024","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30044","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_145_prove":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Provence","profession":"Sniper","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30051","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30062","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30012","count":8}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30063","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30073","count":3},{"id":"30053","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3241","count":4},{"id":"30052","count":4},{"id":"30042","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3243","count":3},{"id":"30024","count":9},{"id":"30063","count":7}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_prove_1","icon":"skchr_prove_1","name":"Wolf's Eye","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"30063","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30084","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30024","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_prove_2","icon":"skchr_prove_2","name":"Prey Seeker","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"30094","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_prove","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"ARC","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_prove","description":"'It's a land in despair with messy hair!'\n'Your first step to glamor, Uncle Vought's Hair Treatment!'\n'......'\nThe model picks her tail up, makes a proud show for the camera... It's amazingly blunt. No lenscraft to speak of at all. Anyone can see how forced she is. After the commercial's over, whether anyone will remember the hair treatment cream is unknown, but the tail will have been undeniably close to perfection, soft and yielding with a gorgeous luster. Even the arc in which it pointed up, idyllic.\n\nProvence hasn't been a model before; she's only a Catastrophe Messenger. There's something she often hears, at least along the lines of it: 'if you can't do your best, you can only do better next time.' 'Better' signals something to compare to, and that signals regret. No one dares say whether the info one gets scrambling across and monitoring the wilds is 100% exact, whether you can get word of a Catastrophe to the epicenter in time, whether you can relay it to everyone there. Regret is part and parcel with a Catastrophe Messenger's work, and 'do better next time' is how they comfort each other. So when Provence had managed to shelter the villagers she'd just brought back from the barrens, and turned back to see a village lost under the violent storm, a village with people still into it, and she wasn't in time to save them, she could only tell herself: 'Don't blame yourself, Provence, settlements are too scattered in the wild, there's not even a comms line, you're doing this on just your own two legs, this was bound to happen... you can only do better next time.'\nThe next day, while she was resupplying at a town, she saw an engineering team. They were firm-hired, helping the local government install a local communications system, and they'd mounted electronic screens at some of the crossroads, so they could... put ads on them. Commercials worshipping quality of life bombarding people, one after another, while villagers in the wilds never even receive any life-or-death Catastrophe alert. Provence sought out the one in charge of the firm, and requested the local system extend its coverage out to the belt of surrounding wilderness. Even just a single emergency comms circuit more would do.\n'Those mucks are starving every day, and you think they can afford a hair treatment? How is this going to do anything for us?'\n'Don't give me that baloney about passing on hope. That's for you Catastrophe Messengers to worry about.'\n'Isn't there any way?' Provence knew this wouldn't work. She was just hung up on how if that emergency line existed, if things could be... that little bit faster in future. Of course she couldn't do her best, but she could do better, and 'better' signals something to compare to, and that signals there's a possibility, so it was down to her to do everything she could.\n'Did you just say your product was for hair treatment?'\n'Maybe—we can work together on this.'","name":"Tail-Care Suit","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"31014","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30094","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31034","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_147_shining":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Shining","profession":"Medic","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30011","count":6},{"id":"30061","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30062","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30012","count":5},{"id":"30062","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30083","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30093","count":4},{"id":"30013","count":5}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3261","count":5},{"id":"30052","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":5}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3263","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":5}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_shining_1","icon":"skchr_shining_1","name":"Creed","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"30083","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30034","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":10}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_shining_2","icon":"skchr_shining_2","name":"Auto Protect","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30093","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"30024","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_shining_3","icon":"skchr_shining_3","name":"Creed Field","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30024","count":4},{"id":"30103","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"30034","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":6}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_shining","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"PHY","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_shining","description":"It was an eerily still night, all light in the mansion extinguished, only moonlight spilling through the window into the room.\nIn the dim and the dark, a precocious daughter was led to her mother's delivery bed.\nStill so young, yet her strict education had already begun, and a sword and scabbard conferred upon her.

It is more a cry than a shout.\nSeeming to heed her voice, the boy's weak chest gives a light flutter. Then, another. The movements from the body's deepest parts grow distinct, as if what lifeforce has passed now returns again.\nPractically leaping to her feet, the mother clutches tight the hands of the strangers who arrived here before them at some point. At a glance, she recognizes the two as Sarkaz, but whether they are the gospels of life or the emissaries of death, she can do little but beg.\nThe white-robed Sarkaz places her hand to the chest of the ailing. The black-cowled, instead, lowers her gaze down at them. What remainders of sunlight still strain past night's shade sink now into the pallid eyes of the dying. Gaze meets gaze again, between he and his mother. From their start to their end, the memories which engrave each passage of a person's life, and the emotions held therein, seep out from their selves, circling them together with the faint light of the setting sun. It is a light of no warmth, and ceases now to flow... simply, its journey is from the eyes of the dead to the eyes of the living.

Each soldier fighting upon the battlefield needed only to lift their head, and they would see eternity in a mirror. It led them to forget thoughts of life or death, and under the King of Sarkaz's command, they conquered all.'\n'Legends of the sort are plentiful in Kazdel,' comes the white-horned physician's response.\n'Placing the living in touch with the boundary between life and death both spurs their courage to rush into death, and leads them to perceive life as something not devoid of meaning. Thus, they bid a better farewell to their loved ones,' Kal'tsit recounts factually.

The coat of arms on her chest is completely scratched off, but the medic, who's trudged across more lands than most, can tell it is of Kazimierzian make.\n'Is your companion resting?' asks the knight softly, her voice filled with apology. 'It truly weighs on me that she should be so frail, yet use her Arts to rescue me. I hoped to be of service to you in some way, which is why I came back.'\n'Please, sit,' answers the medic.\n'No, allow me to be your sentry,' says the knight.\nHer hands grip her warhammer as she stands calm yet firm at five paces out. Her armor is speckled with blood, too; mere hours ago in these twilight wastes, she fought tooth and nail against mercenaries plundering a caravan, the radiance of her Arts nearly enough to convince one that the sun had risen anew. Now, those golden rays merely float about her weapon and body, indistinct. She professes herself to be Infected, afraid of neither the mercenaries' Oripathy, nor of giving her own life.\n'Do you still believe we shouldn't dissuade you?' asks the medic. 'Even though you know full well that despite felling a team of hired soldiers, the mercenary powers camped nearby will continue plundering wherever they please.'\nA lengthy silence. The knight turns her head. The slow rise and fall of the pale-white Sarkaz's chest as she holds her staff, her frail limbs pierced by fine and pointed Originium crystals.\n'I'm sorry, I simply... Perhaps I'm still not used to this.' Finally, she lowers her gaze. 'An insurmountable foe, incurably terminal... It wasn't you I was angry at, back then.'\nHer helpless indignation burns silently in the dark of night. The medic recognizes the naivety in those eyes, those familiar flames not knowing where to burn, that were inevitably snuffed out, one after another, in the misery of the battlefield.\n'I believe that... your willingness to act in defense of others, has sufficed.' She prods the bonfire with a branch, and speaks again with a nod to the knight. 'Please, come and sit.

You all got that?'\nIt's the young Zalaks' first time at the dinner table, learning how to use the tableware, and Hamelin is among them. She's never seen such sumptuous dishes before, their glistening sheen like flowing gold.\n'Hamelin, when I grow up, I'm gonna make sure we eat really tasty food like this every day!'\nHearing the voice beside her perk up, she turns to look and is met with her sweetheart's smile.\nMuch, much later, when she's long since left her tribe, left her beloved, Hamelin skulks alone in the dark. It's been so long she hasn't the energy left to recall the scene. Even filling her stomach is too much to ask now.\nAnother mission nobody else was willing to take. Her failing to contact her target the first time has lost her all her equipment, the only thing saving her life being the ditch she hid in. The aftermath of this mission failure will be hard to shoulder, but she's void of fighting capacity anyhow. Hamelin presses forward, limping against the damp brick wall, eyes sweeping over the putrid filth, searching for anything she can make use of. Eventually, in the thick of the mud, she catches sight of a portable dining set that's been thrown away.\nShe picks it up, wipes it off, hangs it on her waist, and then climbs out of the sewer, finding the restaurant where her target sits.\nIn the process of taking out her target, every item in the set finds its use: the bowl, the spoon, the fork, the knife, the canteen... In a first for her, she's done an efficient job, undetected by anyone. Hamelin exits the lavish, high-end restaurant, and wanders alone onto the streets. She feels famished, completely out of strength. Winding down, she slowly slumps against a wall, pulls in her knees, and buries her head deep.\n'Hello? You hungry? Want something to eat?'\nHamelin raises her head to find a large-tailed Lupo girl. The girl leads Hamelin back to her office, and places before her the remainders of her food supplies.\n'It's all we've got. Put something inside you, okay?'\nWatching Hamelin's movements, her brows suddenly knit.\n'Hey, don't use your hands—you're carrying tableware, aren't you? Are you not that good with it? Let me teach you.\n'Put your food in the bowl, then use that spoon to scoop up a mouthful. You can cut up big chunks of food with a knife, and stick it on your fork to eat it. Hand me your canteen—I'll fill you up some water.\n'If you go hungry again, you're free to stop by every day for something to eat... huh? What's wrong?'\nHamelin stares up, blinking frantically, refusing to let the tears fall from the corners of her eyes.","name":"'Designer Dinnerware'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"30043","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":20000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":15},{"id":"31023","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":25000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":5},{"id":"30033","count":6},{"id":"4001","count":30000}]]}]},"char_150_snakek":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Cuora","profession":"Defender","rarity":"TIER_4","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":2}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30011","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30022","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30032","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30023","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30033","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":45,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":60,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3231","count":3},{"id":"30012","count":1},{"id":"30042","count":1}]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3232","count":5},{"id":"30093","count":14},{"id":"30073","count":10}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_def_up[2]","icon":"skcom_def_up[2]","name":"DEF Up β","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30044","count":1},{"id":"30023","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30064","count":1},{"id":"30044","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"30034","count":2}]]},{"id":"skchr_snakek_2","icon":"skchr_snakek_2","name":"Shell Defense","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30054","count":1},{"id":"30033","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":2},{"id":"30054","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30125","count":2},{"id":"30054","count":2}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_snakek","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"PRO","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_snakek","description":"Aww, naps are so comfy and warm, and when I wake up I can go see the baseball game... Cuora blissfully turns over on the deck.\n\nHuh, where am I?

Someone's crying outside the field, and they've got crystals growing all over their chest, and their baseball got broke in half and they dropped it next to them.\nHello, why are you crying? Oh, I think I know you from somewhere? You're that ball player Ambrois Edwards, right? Look, I wrote your signature on my bat! But I guess I misspelled it as Edgards, heheh!\n...But he pays no attention to her, and continues to weep. The people on the field shoo them out, shouts of anger becoming baseballs pelted at them, striking against the Originium crystals on the player's body. He covers himself tightly with clothing, and gradually becomes a giant, solid, silent stone, losing all light.\nCuora puts her backpack on him, and tells the player she'll take him to Rhodes Island, where they'll be sure to turn him back to normal.\nThey climb over a hill of helmets stacked high, cross a bridge made of bats, ride a baseball through the sky—\nOnce the figure of the landship reveals itself before them, Cuora gleefully shouts, look! We're here! You can get treated here, and you won't need to be scared of getting chased off the field, and you won't have to use clothes to hide the rocks, and then they'll keep cheering your name in all cities everywhere—you're Ambrois the Invincible!\n...The player seems just as happy, and he emerges from the crumbling stone, and reaches an arm out, and waves a bat—\n\nPhew... hey! Who hit my head?!\nLava, lemme tell you about this really long dream I had! It was about... um, what was it about?\nWho cares! C'mon, the ball game's about to begin! And Mister Ambrois finally came out of retirement for this one!\n\n...In the Infected neighborhood, a few railings hem an empty lot, which the people have taken to calling a baseball field.\nCuora sees her idol. The freshly unretired player isn't hiding the crystals on his body, and the cheers drown out all other noise. She jumps and leaps in excitement.\nAbruptly, out on the field, Ambrois waves a hand at her, and steps out of the crowd to give her a light pat on the shoulders. Here in the sun, Cuora sees a smiling face.\nAt this moment, she recalls that kind of a long time ago, she was driven off the baseball field for her own Oripathy. That day, she wandered the streets from end to end, and ran across a weeping ball player.\nShe can't quite remember who it was.

The Inspector pulls a gemstone out of her pocket the size of a burdenbeast's eyeball, glowing in faint green.\n'Well, good Inspector, you certainly know your treasuries!', lauds the Duke, loath as he is to. His territory is tenth on the Inspector's rounds, and the first nine are all extravagant when it comes time for bribes. Not one Inspector hasn't been thoroughly spoiled by the time they make it here.\nThe Inspector strolls up to a corner of the collection, and picks up an altogether unremarkable and antiquated military saber, toying with it amusedly in her hands. Its edge is polished to a shine, reflecting her carmine eyes.\n'What fine taste you have!' As if he's caught sight of prey in his trap, the Duke bustles over to ingratiate himself. 'This precious sword here was one bestowed by the previous Tsar. A perfect spoil for you to take back to Deity Grypherburg, I might think.'\n'How could I repay your generosity for such a precious article, Duke?', the Inspector makes her second question.\n'I simply ask that on your return to Grypherburg, you might recount my service to His Majesty, so I could take part at the capital when he grants his subjects...'\n'So you're telling me, you want the Empire to know of your mines' service, ten years accident-free, accomplished by having everyone who knew of the disaster there buried in a collapsed shaft?'\nThe Inspector's words completely blindside the Duke, and the sycophantic smile freezes on his face.\n'You want the Empire to know of the 'ten thousand bandits' you killed, when half of them were refugees starving to death in your territory?'\nThe color in the Duke's face goes from pale to ghastly. He has never met an Inspector like this before.\n'Or maybe, you want the Empire to know that you, and the past nine Dukes, were all such devout and loyal executioners?' The Government Inspector, with the ceremonial saber at hand, has cast the night pearl worth a king's ransom straight aside. She pulls off her hood, revealing her fiery red hair.

But Durin says I have to write about it.\nEvery child of First Avenue keeps a vault where they stow their valuables away. For example, a door bolt you can use as a gun. (The evil neighbors on the commercial street started copying that, the scoundrels.) As Generalissimo of First Avenue and Third Commercial, my collection was naturally the richest, enough to move anyone who saw it, not to mention the fine collection from the surface...\nDurin stole my pen just now. Said I write too much about nothing and to get to the point. Who cares about her! Why isn't she asleep yet?\nEXAMPLE FROM COLLECTION: Tablecloth that never ever gets dirty (my first treasure). Apparently made of materials my dad invented. Paint and draw all you want and it stays clean. Mysterious! I had to listen to my dad go on forever before I understood how it worked. It looks a lot like a flag, so I decided I would campaign everywhere with it. People back home teased me about it, but it stands witness to my great journey as Generalissimo. I didn't think twice before taking it with me to the surface.\nMy lost treasure is about on par with that tablecloth.\n(Newer handwriting follows, ink still wet.)\nIt's not about the apple! Yes, the apple is a treasure too, but I didn't lose it, I loaned it to Engineering!\nADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENT! The missing treasure was the first thing I obtained when I came aboard, and the operators said it marked me as a member of Rhodes Island. I didn't put any stock in it at first, but came to find that that's just how great Rhodes is: there are new things all over, the operators are wonderful and listen to what I have to say and trust my talent as a generalissimo, and I can be of help to everyone too. And most importantly, nobody laughs at my flag, and the Doctor loves it!\nI'm very happy at Rhodes Island, and that thing has become important to me, and now a treasure.\nI hope that finally clear things up.\n......\n'Myrtle, would that treasure you lost happen to be your... work ID?'\n'That does ring a bell or three... oooohhh, I remember! Yes, that's it!'\n'Um... isn't it right there on your chest, then?'\n'Huh?!'","name":"Private Collections","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"30103","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":20000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":15},{"id":"30033","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":25000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":5},{"id":"31053","count":6},{"id":"4001","count":30000}]]}]},"char_154_morgan":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Morgan","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30031","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30093","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31013","count":3},{"id":"31033","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":3},{"id":"31054","count":8},{"id":"31063","count":11}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_morgan_1","icon":"skchr_morgan_1","name":"Professional Street Fighter","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30064","count":2},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":3},{"id":"30074","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_morgan_2","icon":"skchr_morgan_2","name":"Dauntless Resistance","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31044","count":3},{"id":"30063","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31054","count":3},{"id":"31014","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30155","count":4},{"id":"31034","count":2}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_morgan","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"DRE","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_morgan","description":"Something's definitely new about the Slobberknocker's sign.\nBack in the gym in the lockdown zone, Morgan's first order of business is to check the sign hung over the entrance, with Vina's blessing. The shoddy paint has bubbles trapped in it, and the big 'Slobberknocker' that's been carved is definitely a cleaner job than when Hannah first had a go.\nInside the big lockbox under Morgan's bed rest her dearly beloved Morgan's Memoirs, still safe and sound. After triple-checking it hasn't been touched at any point, she pulls out the good tipple stashed alongside, takes two honking swigs, then chokes and starts hacking and coughing.\nPast its best-by date, but still. If it was a good tipple, it's always worth a try.\nNow fretful, Morgan looks through the pile of old cruft in her box. Something's missing.\nBut it turns out to be a page that's fallen out of her Memoirs, and just a quick skim is enough for her to remember all the details.\nThis was back when their old neighborhood friends weren't taking the Glasgow Gang's biz seriously yet. No denying that Morgan's ideas then were absolute rotters from time to time, stuff like getting outsiders to buff up the gang's standing. Who knew she and the one-track mind Hannah would hit it off so easily? And so they went about harassing plenty of youths from Victoria's other parts.\nUntil Hannah was humiliated at the hands of she who protected those youths, Vina.\nThat was the first time Morgan heard Vina's name, more than a decade ago. Hannah just kept pestering Morgan to talk this 'outsider' Feline into joining the gang. Went as far as talking about 'protecting the neighborhood toy factory' and stuff like that as a front. Shame the Feline in question wouldn't fall for that.\nWhat narked Hannah more was when some noble's servant from the city center came to mess with the toy factory for whatever reason, both she and Morgan tried to stick their heads out for the neighborhood and took a horrid beating instead. And then in the end, who but Vina would show up and shoo the two out of there.\nHannah came back and spent that entire afternoon in a huff. After making a big show to Vina that blew up in their faces, she'd never agree to join now. But to the surprise of both, that night a Vina covered in wounds ran up to the gym cradling a huge box of local specialty toys, banging away on the door.\n'From the toy factory's owner. This way everyone'll know the factory is under Glasgow Gang protection.'\nMorgan made fun of Hannah about it for ages afterwards. The dumbstruck Hannah and the visibly impassioned Vina would become the principal heroes of the Memoirs in time.\nAnd it's ever since then that Morgan's decided deep down to protect Vina. After all, everyone knows the poncey lords doomed themselves by messing with Central.\nIt's there that Vina, wearing a perplexed face and holding a rusted toy, interrupts Morgan's reminiscence.\n'I found this in my room. Do you remember whose it is?'\nMorgan finally twigs what was missing from the box. Up in high spirits, she slings her arm over Vina's shoulders.\n'Let's go ask Hannah. She might know.'\nAt least nobody's changed.","name":"'Iron Heart'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30034","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31054","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31024","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_155_tiger":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Indra","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30051","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30062","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30012","count":8}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30083","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30093","count":2},{"id":"30013","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":4},{"id":"30052","count":4},{"id":"30062","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":3},{"id":"30054","count":7},{"id":"30033","count":16}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_tiger_1","icon":"skchr_tiger_1","name":"Armorcrusher","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30024","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_tiger_2","icon":"skchr_tiger_2","name":"Sundered Soul","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"30093","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30034","count":3},{"id":"30014","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30054","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_tiger","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"FGT","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_tiger","description":"Keep a steady form, and control your pace. This is what the leader of Norport Borough's gang would tell herself. Indra could barely keep herself conscious, but she used all her will to keep herself together and face the enemy head-on. Here, at the decisive moment, all she ought to need was one more jab.\n'You still want to go?' The calm voice of the opposing party was nearly drowned out by the sound of her own heavy gasps for air.\nLoose silver hairs drooped down across her forehead, blocking her vision and blurring out the golden figure standing firm before her, illuminated by a streetlamp. 'Don't be so quick to call yourself the winner, you little shite! I ain't lost yet!' Indra adjusts her breathing and secretly shifts her center of gravity to behind her left hip, all while gathering her hair firmly behind her shoulders. She raises her fists and clenches her fingers, gripping her shabby brass knuckles even tighter than ever before.\n'I'll help you remember, outsider. This here street's mine—Indra of the Glasgow Gang!' As soon as the words were out of her mouth, the silver figure suddenly steps forward, pouncing upon her opponent faster than the eye could see. She lifts her left fist as if putting every last ounce of strength into this one strike, but then commands her body to turn and instead funnel all that strength into her right fist.\nIndra hears the golden-haired girl mutter in her ear: 'I'll remember alright, Indra of the Glasgow Gang.' A tranquil voice, as she always was. Indra still remembers that after, she lost her balance, she fully expected the cold embrace of the cement road, but that hard sensation looming large in her imagination never came. Through closed eyes, it was like she had... fallen onto a ball of sunshine.\n'Run? Run from what? Sorry Vina, I was daydreaming a bit, didn't hear ya.'\n'How to Fight with the Glasgow Gang. This was your work, wasn't it? Rule Number Four, and this is the most important rule: When it comes time to run, remember to run.'\n'Ah, yeah! Pretty much sums up every street fight I've gotten into over the years.'\n'That night we first met, why didn't you run?'\n'Gonna have to have a think on that one.' Indra lowers her head and contemplates for a moment. 'Back then, whenever we ran from a fight, it was so we could survive. For scroungers on the street, nothing's more important'n staying alive. But...'\n'But?' Siege sits up, facing herself towards Indra.\nIndra raises her head, looking right back at Siege. Under the flickering lights of the boxing gym, two pairs of golden eyes face each other, and she sees herself reflected in the Aslan's eyes.\n'But there's no Feline who doesn't like some time under the sun, right?' Indra draws back the corners of her mouth, impishly baring an ivory grin.","name":"'Hannah's Dislocation Rehabilitation Set'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30074","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30094","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_157_dagda":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Dagda","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30051","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30062","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30012","count":8}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"31043","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31063","count":3},{"id":"30093","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":4},{"id":"30032","count":5},{"id":"30062","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":3},{"id":"31024","count":7},{"id":"30013","count":21}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_dagda_1","icon":"skchr_dagda_1","name":"Counter Technique","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"31063","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31044","count":3},{"id":"30064","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_dagda_2","icon":"skchr_dagda_2","name":"Search and Destroy","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30064","count":2},{"id":"30033","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"31014","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30155","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_dagda","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"FGT","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_dagda","description":"This round shield sent from Rhodes Island's Engineering Department seems rather plain, but robust and reliable. Apparently it was the result of the Department holding a 'traditional Victorian arms manufacturing competition' in their spare time. 'This was one of the symbols of a knight,' said the Engineering operator to Dagda in their most charming voice, 'so we decided it'd be best to give it to one of the lady knights making the rounds between Rhodes Island and Victoria.' Dagda looks at the shield proudly displayed atop the table, and can't help but think back to the time before she was accepted as a trainee under the Knights of the Tower.\nBack then, other than the strict physical and tactical training regimens, she also took many classes on knightly etiquette. Amongst the grueling and complicated tests of memory and body language drills, this simple round shield had been a major component of them. The historical piece of military equipment was once used daily by knights of old, but the knights of today have long since left theirs at home when marching to war. They would be hung above fireplaces, or used as a nameplate to display one's identity. Expensive paints were commonly used to draw family crests or the coats of arms of various knightly orders. These brightly-colored designs would cover up the shield's own color, just as their delicate etiquette would cover up the inherent violence a knight represents.\nFinn, the Captain of the Watch, once described a scene of the knights and their dazzling shields to Dagda: During the evenings of celebration days, the knights would parade down the street, clad in fine armor and with arms in hand. Their shields with their crests and blazons would proudly display images of their birthplaces, or warriors in various stances, or myriad different flowers, or great sturdy beasts, or checkered patterns one could weave into a net. The crisp rhythm of the military drums accompanied deep horns enveloping the orderly knights, and by the end of the parade they would all face towards the flame atop the tower. But that tower has long since collapsed, and these knightly tableaus now exist only in Dagda's imagination.\n'I've never actually seen the scene my mentor once described to me.' Recovering her senses somewhat, Dagda continues. 'Just like those books that record the exploits of knights long past, and the ones attempting to define whether a knight's life was glorious and honorable, my position as a knight is long gone. If you asked me if there's still anything worth engraving on that...' Dagda takes the shield off to the workshop, where she draws what she considers to be her emblem—a coat of arms from the streets.","name":"Backstreet Shield","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31054","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31044","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_158_milu":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Firewatch","profession":"Sniper","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30061","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30012","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30083","count":2},{"id":"30103","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3241","count":4},{"id":"30062","count":3},{"id":"30052","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3243","count":3},{"id":"30034","count":7},{"id":"30073","count":15}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_milu_1","icon":"skchr_milu_1","name":"Camouflage","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"30094","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_milu_2","icon":"skchr_milu_2","name":"Tactical Transceiver","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30024","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30034","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_milu","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"DEA","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_milu","description":"The leaves were inserted into a small novel as bookmarks. \n\n'The Knight's Forest,' page 21. \n'Let me join your knight squad!' \n'Ask again when you're a little older.' \n'That's what you said last time!

He followed the girl quietly, curious as to what she planned to do. But when he saw her scouting out a sniping position, camouflaging into the environment, and then landing three clean shots in a row, he changed his mind. \nThe captain appeared in front of the girl as she dragged the corpse of the gloompincer back to town, the slain beast almost bigger than herself. \n'Come with me from now on.' \nThe girl lifted her head with a smile across her muddied face. \n\n'The Knight's Forest,' page 53. \nTime flies, and so the young girl grew up.

How could Ursus possibly know our precise location? It's utterly impossible, unless––' \nThe girl didn't have time for idle thoughts. The most important thing was to break free from the enemy's siege.

At the break of dawn, Vulcan takes her tongs in hand to pluck out a half-molten glowing red lump of iron from the forge, placing it atop the Shaper and suddenly remembering what a priest from Lachedamon once told her. 'It is destruction, a destruction that cannot be avoided.'\nShe gently flicks her wrist, then begins to beat the iron with her hammer. When Vulcan still lived in Minos, she would use any spare time she had to visit the hall where the memories of heroes of generations past were honored. There, she and her friends whiled away their time. She would say very little, preferring to listen attentively to the various sermons and debates of others.\n'As for why man pursues eternity, we strike the earth with enough fervor as to seem mad, hoping to reveal some scant ruins with a handful of phrases carved upon them, only to proceed to worship them as fragments of some eternity itself. Even were we merely to confirm that the concept of 'eternity' even exists, that alone would be comfort enough to those of us fated to die one day.'\nVulcan thinks back to the candles that stood before the statues in the hall back then. Those offered by the pilgrims in praise of their ancestors burned silently, somewhat resembling the very same people there to pray, awed and quieted by the words of the priests. Afterwards, the more their flames grew weaker, the more they danced madly out of control, much like the thoughts of those silent pilgrims. Once more she uses her tongs to pick up the iron that has just begun to take shape, and plunges it into the water. It hisses and sputters in surprise, before quieting down just as quickly. Once more she places the iron into the furnace, treating it the same way she did before, over and over again.\nVulcan truly understands the Minoans' obsession with these grandiose sentiments, for Minos was far too ancient, and yet Minos was far too young. Its history stretched back towards infinity, yet it had nearly died. Though she is not particularly interested in either the worship of eternity nor dreaded mortality, to take it a step further, she believes this to be a common point between the cultures of Sargon and Minos, one bred in both their hearts. An irrelevant, elusive dream. \nShe places the finished work upon her anvil. This unremarkable iron ingot was the daily task of Minoan blacksmiths, passed down from generation to generation. One day in the future, it will find itself in a different shape, or perhaps reforged into the already-broken spine of some equipment. She powers down the furnace, and takes out some honey biscuits she had baked at the same time. I care only for the present, she tells herself.","name":"The Shaper","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30064","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_164_nightm":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Nightmare","profession":"Caster","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30011","count":10}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30063","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30073","count":3},{"id":"30053","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3251","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":7},{"id":"30042","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3253","count":3},{"id":"30024","count":7},{"id":"30083","count":14}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_nightm_1","icon":"skchr_nightm_1","name":"Drain Soul","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"30063","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30084","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_nightm_2","icon":"skchr_nightm_2","name":"Night Phantom","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"30094","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30034","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_nightm","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"CCR","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_nightm","description":"CONSULTATION RECORDING N-02 20:37\nAre you feeling better now, Gloria?\nA bit.

How would you feel?\nI don't know... [COUGH] Sorry, I need more water.\nRelax, it's okay. Now, we're going to try a slightly different method for our chat.\nI'm going to have you recall some quite deep memories. Don't worry, I promise it can't hurt you in any way.\nMm.

And did she do anything else?\nAh... [COUGH]! Water, I need...\nCalm down, take me through slowly.\nHere—agh! That's my hand!\nHeh. Heheh.\n'Nightmare'! But why wasn't there any sign?\nOh, Gloria clearly warned you, you just didn't notice. What did you think? My imitation of her's quite a good one, isn't it?\nRequesting backup!

He approached it with liniment and gauze in hand, applying the medicine in the bottle to the wound before bandaging it up.\nIt struggled a little at first, but was too weak to do anything but accept the boy's treatment before falling into a deep slumber.\nOn the second day, the boy took it back to where it had been found. They wandered through the woods for an entire day until the boy was exhausted and gasping for breath, but in the end found only the remains of two adult fowlbeasts. He built a small grave for them, then turned to it and said:\n'Now, both of us are in the same boat.'\nThe boy took it back to his room, and the tiny nest inside became its new home.\nThe boy would come check on it every day. He liked to gently wipe its plumage while chatting with it, unconcerned with whether it could understand him.\n......\nLike that one night, when the boy approached it with a sullen face and said:\n'I'm confident I have what it takes to be a strong clan leader or a good brother, but I cannot guarantee I can do both at once.'\nThe boy sighed as he spoke.

In the end, he sighed again and said, 'Alas, you're the only who can hear me out. I'd better think of a farewell gift for him now.'\n......\nAnd like that day when its wounds healed, and the boy took it out to the snowy plains to practice flying. When it was about to take off, he took out a black silk scarf, tied the fabric around its neck, and asked:\n'Will you come with me?'\n—At that moment, the boy had already decided to set aside the burdens of being a clan leader and depart from the Snow Realm to study abroad.\nIt simply cocked its head and looked at him.\nOf course, it did not know what the boy was worried about, why he was anxious, or why he was sad.\nBut perhaps, it sensed that the boy, just like it, did not wish to stay confined in a warm room. He wished to soar beneath the blue sky—\nIt spread its wings and leapt forward.\nThen, to the boy's happy, surprised shouts, it took off with the wind.\nOn that day, it learned to fly once again.","name":"Snow Realm Fowlcare Kit","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30145","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30155","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_173_slchan":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Cliffheart","profession":"Specialist","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30011","count":10}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30083","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30093","count":2},{"id":"30013","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3281","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3283","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":6},{"id":"30083","count":13}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_slchan_1","icon":"skchr_slchan_1","name":"Chain Hook","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30024","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30034","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_slchan_2","icon":"skchr_slchan_2","name":"Binding Chains","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"30093","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30034","count":3},{"id":"30014","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30064","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_slchan","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"HOK","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_slchan","description":"What does 'peak' mean to a climber?\nA sort of height?

At the foot is her brother, Sir Enciodes, and the whole Silverash family, and atop the mountain is her sister, the Saintess of all Kjerag.\nShe's already scaled Karlan before, and whether to conquer or connect, she's succeeded.\nBut we've received word today that Miss Ensia has taken gold in a Bolívarian mountaineering event.\nAn honor she's put her life on the line for, with dangers beyond anyone's imagination.\nThe hosts' climate monitoring systems had malfunctioned, and the competitors were faced midway with a snowstorm and a series of ice cracks out of nowhere. With the vast majority having no way forward, the hosts announced the event was suspended, and organized a squad to rescue any competitors who hadn't yet returned to base camp. On top of that, Miss Ensia had lost her communications gear, insulated tent, and part of her food supply while escaping danger. In these extreme circumstances, every second longer out there was a matter of life or death, but she'd already overcome the most difficult, perilous ice ridge known to Terra, and the summit was calling. So, should she retreat, or should she turn around and continue up?\n......\nAfter Miss Ensia came to, the first thing she reportedly said to the medical personnel was this: 'The sight from the summit was amazing!'\nThe hosts proclaimed the event still valid, and gave the trophy to Miss Ensia, as the one and only award-winner.\nThe distant peaks beyond Kjerag have none of Kjeragandr's divine protection. Miss Ensia was no more than a competitor from strange parts. She succeeded in planting her flag at the very top, all just for a view of the unknown.\n......\nTo end today's special program, we leave you with a quote from the hosts' speech when they gave the award:\n'She is a true climber.'\n—Special report made on-the-spot by the network after news of Cliffheart winning a Bolívarian mountaineering event made its way back to Kjerag.

Generations of Kjerag Saintesses sat here deep in thought upon deciphering their ancient scriptures, digesting the ideas and their meaning to the people of the Snow Realm.\n'Enya. Enya!'\nEnya awakens from her slumber, wipes her mouth, and touches her warm cheeks heated by the fireplace. She flashes an embarrassed smile.\n'Sorry, Kjarr...'\n'Enciodes, Head of Clan Silverash, was just here.'\n'Now? To see me?'\n'No. He had only a few words of blessing for the Saintess and asked me to deliver this to you.'\nEnya takes a small, delicate bell with intricate engravings from the maid. She lifts the thing and gently shakes it, filling the room with a pleasant and melodious ringing.\n'He called it a gift for the Saintess, a product of the factories now operating in Silverash territory. There are many more such bells, hanging in the fields down below.'\nEnya fixes her gaze on the gift. She fully understands Enciodes's meaning. When she was a child, he joined her in making bells from the scrap iron discarded by their father's factories. They hung the bells together with Ensia in the vast fields, waiting for the wind to ring them.\n'Would you kindly stow it for me? Along with the other gifts from before.'\nShe hesitates for a moment before stopping the maid.\n'I recall something in the bottom cabinet at my bedside. Do please bring it to me. Thank you.'\nThe maid returns with a half-finished scarf, clearly made for a man. The soft threads intertwine, the fabric thick, the needlework flawless. What is done can be described as no less than perfect.\n'This must be...'\n'I began making this for Enciodes when he was away in Victoria. I intended to finish it and gift it to him when he returned. For various reasons, it has remained incomplete.'\n'You've kept it with you all these years... You still hold a glimmer of hope for him?'\n'Kjarr, over the course of my life as the Saintess, I've read all the scriptures in the sanctuary. The texts document a thousand years of Kjerag history. And yet, there is one question the scriptures do not appear to answer.'\n'And what is that?'\n'How to knit.'\nEnya falls into silence. She recalls a time, long ago, when her father sat by the window, knitting scarves for his children. Sunlight bathed his face. Her brother was practicing his swordsmanship outside, and her sister was perusing a book of mountain landscape paintings. She quietly watched by her father's side, one needle at a time, committing it all to the deepest part of her memory. This is how she learned to knit.\nThe texts contain plenty of knowledge, but there are some questions they will never answer. Or perhaps she already knew the answer to her knitting question, her family questions, her questions about the future.\n'Tomorrow is the Tri-Clan Council, yes?'\n'Indeed. The other two clans are likely to unite against Clan Silverash. I do wonder how Enciodes will respond.'\n'No matter how he does, in the end, the matter will no doubt fall to me.'\n'Are you so certain?'\n'He is a Silverash, as am I.'\nEnya punctuates her statement by standing up, startling her maid. She uses all her strength to throw open the heavy curtains. For the first time in a thousand years, sunlight floods the dim room.\nShe stands in the light, needles dancing between her fingers. The new thread merges with that already woven. She continues her needlework, not for any man in particular, but for the future the scarf represents.\n'The children of Clan Silverash each walk their own paths.'","name":"'Knitting of a Future'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30064","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30084","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_179_cgbird":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Nightingale","profession":"Medic","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30021","count":5},{"id":"30051","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30012","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":4},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30093","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30103","count":3},{"id":"30033","count":5}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3261","count":5},{"id":"30062","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3263","count":4},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30054","count":6}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_heal_up[3]","icon":"skcom_heal_up[3]","name":"Healing Up γ","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30093","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"30024","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_cgbird_2","icon":"skchr_cgbird_2","name":"Arts Shield","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30024","count":4},{"id":"30103","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"30034","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"30064","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_cgbird_3","icon":"skchr_cgbird_3","name":"Sanctuary","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30034","count":4},{"id":"30013","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":5}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_cgbird","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"RIN","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_cgbird","description":"To come in contact with life is a miraculous feeling. \nUnlike the hardships, sorrows, and pain that people exhibit, life is always full of vitality. \nWith the release of Originium Arts, a new form of connection is created. \nBetween my life, and theirs. \nBy taking on their pain, Originium activates, promoting the blooming of life, and healing takes root. \nThis process seems to be significantly different from modern medical procedures. \nBut for me, results speak loudest. \nBecause I endured a little more pain, others can be born anew. \nThis is very good. \nBut... if I could be like ordinary people, without this physical pain, that spark of hope in my heart would surely shine a little bit brighter. \nUnfortunately, as I am now, I can only rely on others to survive. \nLike a light crystal in a lantern.

Also, would very much like approval for adding a music player.\nOVERVIEW FROM ENGINEERING DEPT.: Fernand II 3-wheel motorcycle, manufactured before Battle of the Four Emperors, antique. Mr. Greypaw conducted fullbody inspection, says original parts hard to find because of age. Re safety: vehicle as old as this should be in museum, not speeding on roads. Greypaw explained this to Earthspirit, Earthspirit stated vehicle originally belonged to mentor Prof. Bachmann. Earthspirit oft. sat in sidecar holding boxes of stones, following mentor everywhere on field investigations. Prof. Bachmann gifted vehicle to her at graduation, and asked her to keep a promise. At present, Prof. Bachmann is deceased. Left only this Fernand II behind, always reminding Earthspirit not to forget promise. Earthspirit rides this motorcycle on vacation, sidecar usually filled with various stones when she returns, plus other Catastrophe Messengers hitchhike on occasion.\nVIEW OF ENGINEERING DEPT.: Given special nature of Earthspirit's dept. plus direct superior of that dept. being the Doctor, this form to be passed onto the Doctor.\n\nTO BE EXPENSED: Installation of suppressor for tuning fork\nJUSTIFICATION: Sound has been bothering people more lately.

Especially for you. Oh, but don't get me wrong—they look cute on you. You gonna wear them to field training?'\nMousse hesitates, gauging Haze's reaction. Seeing the genuine approval on her face, she nods.\n'I heard that field training involves a lot of hands-on exercises where they call up the operators to demonstrate. There's no way I'd be able to hide my hands. So I thought, instead of keeping them hidden behind my back, I should make them look less intimidating.

The vehicle she was riding in was ambushed and set ablaze. All the operators inside were trapped behind a jammed door, unable to escape. With no time to think, Mousse used her mutated hands to tear an opening, allowing everyone to get out safely. Because of that, she had been encouraged to apply for field operator training.\nMousse looks at the combat report again. At first, she can't help but look at her 'terrifying' hands. However, her focus gradually shifts to the operators in the vehicle. She thinks about how they worked together and how she had felt at that moment—so overwhelmed she had nearly cried. She looks down at her hands, lost in thought.\n'Welcome, everyone, to basic field operator training. First, let's meet our newest recruit.

He'll fix you up and be gentle about it.\nBut if your primary doctor is Gavial, I have one piece of advice for you: don't try and be smart with her, just do exactly as she says. If you've been treated by Gavial before, you know what I'm talking about, and I know you know.\nBut seeing as this primer is aimed at giving all you adorable, blank-slate newbies some advice from the deep end of the pool, I want you to read what follows very carefully.\nFirstly: no matter what rumors you've heard, don't be scared. Gavial is a professional medic who's qualified to practice. Her medical expertise is a genuine thing of envy aboard Rhodes. If she says she's going to treat you, but approaches you with tools that look extremely dangerous (including but not limited to hammers/drills/impact drivers), then stay where you are and do not move. There is a very high probability she IS coming to fix up your wounds. Of course, we can't rule out the scenario where she just seized a bunch of new toys from the enemy as spoils, and really wants to show them off to you, in which case you may express a suitable degree of admiration for her, BUT DO NOT GO TOO FAR, or she may beat you up.\nSecondly: please, follow her medical instructions to the letter, 100%. Don't complain no matter how bitter the medicine she made you take, because she means well. If she's laid down strict dietary restrictions for you, you obey them perfectly, unless you have miracle Arts that let you hide what you've been eating from everyone forever, which you don't. She's a good doctor who takes great responsibility for her patients, and if she finds you refusing to follow instructions, the consequences will likely be Very Bad. The Rhodes Island Medical Department does not accept complaints about that.\nLastly: when you're wounded on the battlefield and need emergency aid, please report in to Gavial ASAP. Otherwise, she may run out of anesthetics, in which case she's exceedingly likely to prep you for treatment using a technique she personally innovated and dubbed 'kinetic anesthesia.' It's been appraised by Medical as 'tentatively safe, but patient experience has been relatively poor.'\nThis author has been a casualty of said technique, and can VERY responsibly report there's a little more to the experience than 'relatively poor.'","name":"'Follow Your Doctor's Orders'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"30013","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":20000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":15},{"id":"31013","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":25000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":5},{"id":"30023","count":6},{"id":"4001","count":30000}]]}]},"char_188_helage":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Hellagur","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30031","count":6},{"id":"30041","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30052","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30083","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30093","count":4},{"id":"30013","count":5}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":5},{"id":"30022","count":10},{"id":"30012","count":6}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30034","count":7}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_helage_1","icon":"skchr_helage_1","name":"Crescent Moon","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30024","count":4},{"id":"30103","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"30034","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_helage_2","icon":"skchr_helage_2","name":"Half Moon","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30034","count":4},{"id":"30013","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_helage_3","icon":"skchr_helage_3","name":"Full Moon","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"30023","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30074","count":4},{"id":"30054","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":5}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_helage","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"SBL","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_helage","description":"Hellagur took the pocket watch and blade from his friend without even a chance to ask a question. The life had already left his friend's body.\nAt the time, he didn't yet know that an unprecedented Great Rebellion was about to ignite war across Ursus, and this lost battle, coupled with the army's disobedience, was only the rebellion's mildest prelude.\nHe could only vaguely sense that, although the storm-in-a-teacup had already dissipated, an unusual calm still lingered.\nHellagur hung the scabbard on his waist and drew out the strange Higashinese sword. He examined it for a moment, but there were no familiar characters on the blade. He placed the sword on the table, presently covered with a battlefield map. The cold and slender blade lay vertically over the tangled front line, forming a large X on the map.\nHe opened the pocket watch to find a photo of a strange girl on the inside. She looked reticent, with only her eyes showing a liveliness and curiosity that matched her age.\nAt that moment, the girl walked out of the shadow in the corner of the command center.\nHer face, figure, clothing, and even the Originium crystal on her shoulder were identical to those in the photo.\nOnly her gaze was different from the one in the photo when she looked at Hellagur.\nThere was no curiosity, no panic, and even hostility seemed thin in her eyes. He could only detect calmness in them, as if her emotional quota had been exhausted by the war.\nHe tried to talk to her, showing her the photo in the watch, and even pointing to the sword on the table, but the girl just stared at him silently, in the same way he had stared at his friend's corpse in silence.\nHellagur realized that, like the sword, this was probably not the first time the girl had been entrusted to someone.\n\nShe suddenly snatched up the sword, which was even taller than her.\nShe held the blade and walked unsteadily towards him.\nThe tall Liberi didn't say anything. The way the girl held it didn't seem like she was preparing to strike.\nOf course, it was possible there were special Higashinese ways to wield the Higashinese sword, or maybe the girl was pretending to make an effort to hold the sword in a way that would keep the edge from being worn on the ground, and he was moments away from having the cold blade pressed against his throat.\nBut Hellagur didn't move.\n\nThe girl's wrist trembled, and she struggled to move to his side. She raised the sword up high, with the tip pointing at the ground.\nHe lowered his head and met the girl's gaze.\nShe seemed to be pleading for something.\nHe didn't know what she was asking for, but he nodded nonetheless.\nWhoosh.\nThe girl inserted the sword into the scabbard at Hellagur's waist.\nThen she spoke.

Their supplies were spent, and Hellagur was left wanting for even a drop of fresh water as his wounded men-in-arms laid by his side stifling deep groans. He pulled a scar-riddled samovar out from his marching pack, and wearily put a potful of snow to the boil. This one samovar would accompany him for a long, long time to come; each time Neon takes a tea break, she'll mumble about how she ought to throw it away, but of course, she's only saying it.\nNeon's letter lies on the table. Which hurts more to an old man: a young child leaving home because they can't be bothered to communicate with you, or a grown child leaving home out of consideration for how you'd disapprove?\nHellagur has been reflecting on whether his approach to parenting might be suspect. At first, he had no idea how to build a rapport with the taciturn child, sure in his mind that there was no way for him to meaningfully raise her. Bitter war, constant upheaval, blight and suffering... He'd seen that all of these had already made their place in her eyes. The best he could hope for was to teach Neon that life was more than these. He brought more into her life, taught her an appreciation for classical music, to play the cello, to read and write... When did Neon change? After she was found secretly taking part in the Clinic's transport of Oripathy medication? Since leaving Chernobog, she's become her own dignified spokeswoman. From settling patients to partnered pharmaceutical research between the Clinic and Rhodes Island, Neon handled many aspects of rebuilding Azazel. Medical and clinical administration were never Hellagur's strong points anyway... Neon often vanishes, only to show back up with a new headache or two for him... Perhaps this was how she always was, but suffice to say, it's how she likes it.\nHellagur is glad he can still protect such a lifestyle.\n...Hence, he regrets not properly hiding the letter.\nThat winter, they'd done everything they could, and had the Clinic's patients, doctors, and medical resources all evacuated from Chernobog... Yet the name 'Azazel' was forsaken there, left behind.\nThese days, new nomadic plates sit atop the ruins, an omnipresent smog of industry and checkpoints and the Ursus Guard, still going by the name of 'Chernobog.' And Azazel has been 'rebuilt' in a sense, the Emperor's overseers tacitly letting it exist. 'Azazel.' The name itself something to believe in. Once, it was a rare respite to those the Empire deemed scar tissue, a safe haven in the endless nights. With no hesitation, the Infected chose where it had once been to come together again, and even the Infected that wandered the wilds and tundras came too, of their own accord.\nTo Ursus, they always were hideous scars. Had the events of 1096 been sufficient to change the Empire's attitude towards them? The answer is laughable. In the so-called 'Federal Territory of Chernobog' is no Ursus Guard, who only care to stand watch outside of it, and to Hellagur, and of course to Neon, the role that the vaunted 'Azazel' plays atop those ruins is all too clear. In the new plate crammed full of Infected, death and disappearance may be diluted in the greater chaos, but they are still taking place, right this very moment.\nThe hot-blooded child cannot stand such a thing. She quietly comes back, brews a pot of tea for Hellagur, and then takes Decapitator and leaves without a goodbye...\nSteam lifts the lid as the water within boils louder and louder, slowly drowning out the sound of the samovar itself.\nQuiet, now. Quiet as the dead winter grass.\n'We can never hope to be an opponent to Ursus.

No one knows who put it there, nor what settlement it belongs to. It's lifted by a crude pole stuck into the earth, wind sweeping up sand and flying the banner straight.\nA passerby sees the design upon it and is struck by vague familiarity, but where he's seen it before totally escapes him. A cloth with the same design covers the grain pile back at his home, dust having long worn that special symbol away.\nHe sees the towering flag and pulls out his hatchet, thinking to cut the flagpole down. The fabric seems sturdy and strong, the pole suitable for firewood. Unwanted by anyone, he may as well chop it down and put it to better use. Just like how every settlement in this stretch of the wild fights one another over soil and resources, ultimately evolving into ever more brand-new civilizations.\nThe axe hacks into the pole, but cannot cut it. He puts a hand out to shake it, but the flag defiantly flies even straighter in greeting the sun. He hocks a glob of spit onto the ground, shifts away from the light, and squints his eyes as he looks up. The material's very new. Not yet stained by rain or dirt. The burlap flaunts its sheen.\nA few days ago, a mechanical arm brushed aside the traps set all around its cabin home, picking flax from the long-forsaken waste, and weaving as its Mom and Dad once taught it. The hand so used to bows was somewhat clumsy, but the metal hand briskly rolled the flax into thread.\nSuppose one said this arm used to be treasured for how it could draw a bow with greater force—now, it had its owner's full interest for how meticulously it could weave. But the mechanical arm understood none of this; it simply followed its master's will, making good on what she saw fit.\nA few years ago, the arm's owner thankfully told the old man that installed it how she would use it to further her revenge. In time, she used the greater force within it to loose arrows into the bodies of mercenaries. She looked at the things they left behind, at the unfamiliar symbol on them—the story of her. Time stopped here, and not a soul remembers all that he was before. She pulled her cloak off, fixing it tight to the wound that almost saw her windpipe slit open. Revenge can easily wipe away a person's past. She didn't want to turn out the same way when her demise came.\nSo she returned to her home, wove this mantle, sought out a firm flagpole, and stuck it rigidly into the soil.\nIt is the final remaining symbol of this settlement in the wilds, and she used her vengeful arm to weave this memento of civilization. The flag rises, the steel arm's owner walks her new path, and those who pass by the banner will recall the pattern she wove.","name":"'Still Alive'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"30073","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":20000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":15},{"id":"31033","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":25000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":5},{"id":"30053","count":6},{"id":"4001","count":30000}]]}]},"char_192_falco":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Plume","profession":"Vanguard","rarity":"TIER_3","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":1}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30061","count":1}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30012","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30022","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":1},{"id":"30053","count":1}],[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30063","count":1}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":40,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":55,"evolveCost":[]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_quickattack[1]","icon":"skcom_quickattack[1]","name":"Swift Strike α","masteryCosts":[]}],"modules":[]},"char_193_frostl":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Frostleaf","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_4","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":2}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30031","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30042","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30052","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30023","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30033","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":45,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":60,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":3},{"id":"30032","count":1},{"id":"30042","count":1}]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3222","count":5},{"id":"30093","count":15},{"id":"30083","count":7}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_frostl_1","icon":"skchr_frostl_1","name":"Frost Tomahawk","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30044","count":1},{"id":"30023","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30064","count":1},{"id":"30044","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30135","count":2},{"id":"30074","count":2}]]},{"id":"skchr_frostl_2","icon":"skchr_frostl_2","name":"Ice Tomahawk","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30054","count":1},{"id":"30033","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":2},{"id":"30054","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"30104","count":2}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_frostl","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"LOR","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_frostl","description":"In second pocket of backpack's compartment.

Anna wasn't any better; though she was clearly trying to keep her emotions in check, I could tell that she was panicking. Sonya felt like she had a duty to protect the others, so she kept her hand tightly gripped around her axe. I always thought her hand was going to slip one of these days.\nUnder that atmosphere, everyone was constantly on edge. And to make matters worse, nobody knew if what we were doing was right or wrong.\nLada wanted to be of help—she felt like she was always sheltered by Sonya, and was afraid of being left behind—so she'd go out and try to find us something to eat, though she came back with empty hands most of the times. Anna wanted the group to be more 'stable,' so she'd try to strike up conversations, but they seldom went the way she wanted. Sonya was generally in high spirits, but every so often she'd come back with an extra wound or two.\nEveryone did their best to get something done, as if they'd go mad if they didn't. Though sometimes, you could get rid of the 'as if' part.\nAs for me, I was never that scared in the first place, but it's not like I'd have been happy dying there. I didn't want to lose Sonya and the others either—we'd been friends already. So, I also did whatever I could: bringing back supplies, helping Sonya 'take out the trash,' and even teaching some harsh lessons to anyone who tried to lay their hands on Anna.\nAt first I thought things would get better, but it was actually the opposite. Lada and Anna started avoiding eye contact with me, and even Sonya would strangely glare at me. That's when I understood: I'd been robbing them of their agency.\nBut I was better at those things, so why shouldn't I do it?\nOf course, I was never the petty type, and it's not like Lada or Sonya really blamed me for that. I knew they were both real nice, we just didn't know how to get along back then. It wasn't until the day Sonya came back from a scuffle with a serious tear in her uniform and Anna used a sewing kit I'd scavenged to fix it up that I realized what I needed to do.\nI snuck into the warehouse, found some coats, and brought them to Anna to ask her if she could fix them up into something more cold-resistant. We'd need them later when the weather turned cold, and sure enough, she cheered up at that.\nAfter that, I risked my hide to steal some Reunion kitchenware for Lada so it'd be easier for her to cook, though obviously it was better to keep that part low-key. Her eyes lit up the instant she saw what I brought back.\nI even found some self-defense equipment for everyone, and modified them with Sonya. While we were working together, I thumped my chest and said to her: If there's anything you want, just say the word and I'll get it for you. Sonya stared at me for a while, but this time, she nodded.\nLooking back now, it was probably around then that our team actually started taking shape.","name":"The Old Clothes","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30054","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_195_glassb":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Istina","profession":"Supporter","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30031","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30103","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30013","count":4},{"id":"30063","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3271","count":4},{"id":"30032","count":5},{"id":"30052","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3273","count":3},{"id":"30064","count":5},{"id":"30103","count":9}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_glassb_1","icon":"skchr_glassb_1","name":"Concentration","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30024","count":3},{"id":"30103","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"30024","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_glassb_2","icon":"skchr_glassb_2","name":"Literature Storm","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30034","count":3},{"id":"30013","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":3},{"id":"30034","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30054","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_glassb","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"DEC","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_glassb","description":"Pastry flour 180g; cystymilk 120g; icing sugar 90g; dried berries 60g; fowl yolk 22g; salt 1g\nThey might be the most basic cookies, but Gummy loves these.\nLet cystymilk sit at room temperature, then add the icing sugar.

She already knew how to get a little warmth while sleeping alone, and how to avoid being discovered by other refugees or the Reunion Movement. It wasn't actually time to sleep, but she was too tired. In hopes of getting Lada a little soup with flavor for her fever, Sonya grabbed half a leather belt off another group of refugees. And, of course, they didn't let her go easy. They chased Sonya all the way back to their hiding place. The commotion woke the already weak and drowsy Natalya. She used the huge weapon she had been carrying on her back for the first time.\nA few days ago, they dragged it out of a burnt-out ruin, and after inspecting the remaining parts, despair yet again cast its shadow on their hearts—it was practically unusable. Natalya describes it as a former siege weapon, now abandoned. Several eyes looked it over only to fall into silence.\nBut Natalya still found a few almost-usable cloth straps and fixed the huge device to her shoulder. Anna and Sonya said nothing, they just clutched their own handy weapons tightly and walked on in silence. Natalya followed.\nThe massive weapon now rested across the bottom of Lada's neck, covered with a layer of found fabric, making it just a little bit softer. It didn't actually fire anything that could cause any real damage in the recent scuffle, but Natalya stood in front of a few already-broken refugees, and snapped off a component of unknown function—the weapon worked strangely, a mixture of thick black smoke and flames gushed out, igniting the debris next to it. The fire drove off the refugees who were pursuing Sonya, meaning they lost their own hiding place.\nSeveral hands tugged at the plastic sheet in the corner. Anna coughed weakly, trying to muffle the sound in her throat. Sonya stared into space with her eyes wide open, not allowing herself to sleep. The flickering flames in the distance reflected on their faces. The feverish Lada suddenly clenched her fists and woke up from her sleep, muttering and grabbing the small pot next to her, preparing to rush out.\nAnna skillfully placed her hand over Lada's forehead, and Sonya pressed down the corner of the plastic sheet to prevent the wind from coming in. Through the gap in the sheet, they saw the dark night sky, glittering stars, and Natalya, still cowering alone nearby. Lada murmured and reached out to her, and after grabbing her equally pale hand, she quieted down and slowly fell back asleep.\nThe next day, Natalya felt an unfamiliar warmth beside her. When she woke up, she saw a small, yellow, dirty star-shaped plush toy hanging off her weapon, swaying back and forth. Lada wrinkled her nose and laughed.\n\nRhodes Island.\n'Please wait a moment, Sonya. I'm not ready yet.'\n'Ugh, you suck, Natalya.'\n'Listen, you're a logistics operator, and you're the one who applied for a replacement weapon. How did I end up being the one pushing <i>you</i> through the process?'\n'Because I suddenly realized that I've gotten used to it.'\n'You've never even fired the thing. The last time you tried, the pile of scrap almost exploded on you.'\n'I know how maximally utilize its functions.'\n'You told us it was a military siege weapon.'\n'Well, I like its color.'\n'Ugh, are you screwing with me? Do you wanna use it or not?'\nThe white-haired girl laughed. She fiddled with a dirty, tattered, star-shaped plush toy behind her back and remembered the night when she huddled with her companions for warmth.\n'I've changed my mind. I don't want to replace it.

Shields and blades firm in hand, they noted, out of the corners of their eyes, the Caprinae woman standing by their master's side.\nThey were all sure that with this Caprinae bodyguard by his side, no attempt would ever succeed.

Only a single member of Enciodes's guards, one who spends a considerable amount of time merely couriering Kjerag's letters to boot. People are fond of the faint scent on the letters he handles, and of his cheery face, and they admire his loyalty to Enciodes.\nBut no one would've imagined he had this side to him too.\nWhy? Nobody had asked Weiss to go so far. Being all on his own, simply passing on the word would've sufficed. He could've found somewhere to hide, and mustered enough defense to cope with this spate of traitors.\nEnciodes looks over Weiss, but makes no move to ask him anything. Weiss sorts out the letters and documents on the table and deferentially excuses himself.

Her groans, each higher than the last, drew the livestock close one after another, forming a circle with her inside. Those livestock were warm of fur—so thick yet fine—keeping the blizzard away, and the hot breath from their mouths and noses became a wall, providing enough warmth for your mother's labor.\nYou were born, your face so filthy, and you bawled in tears. I put out my hand and caressed your eyelids, shut so firm, my rough skin brushing the corners of your eyes red. I was born with a pair of wide, rugged hands, in which your grandfather took pride, saying I would be a man who could feed his family, but that day they caused you to cry without end.\nThen your mother swatted away my hand in annoyance, and I laughed, about to pull my finger away, when your arm found its way out from your swaddle and gripped my finger tight. You see? You were only but the size of my hand, yet you made me panic like nothing else, and I stood there dumb in the snow, not moving a step.\nThe blizzard that had been screaming outside forced its way into this delivery circle the livestock formed, the red retreating from your skin, naked to the wind, and an ominous purple spreading over. Your mother opened the fore of my robe and pressed you against my bosom. Carefully and cautiously I wrapped it again, as if caring for my own second heart. And your face frozen frigid by the cold was warmed by my body, and finally you ceased to cry, and simply sucked your fingers and took small, weak breaths. Then your mother climbed onto my back, and called for the livestock to return home with a whistle. Their tumbling hides bounded across the gentle, narrow slope down the mountain, and I was like their leader, with her riding tenderly on my back, and you so frail against my chest, though my legs shivered as they sank into the ankle-deep snow. Like I was bearing the weight of all the land.\nThat robe later opened a hole right at its chest, which must have been from some Holy Hunt or other. Last year your mother unearthed it from our wardrobe's depths, where I had all but forgotten it. Your mother chose to repair it so finely it in the end, and asked if I would still wear it. I shook my head no, saying we would best send it to you. I'm well into my age now, and stoop more with each passing day, but you are in the prime of your youth, standing tall as the mountains, never to fear the north wind nor the icy snow. All else aside, I want you to have it. I imagine you'll look just the same as I did when you wear it, no? So wear it, and come drop by.

He dug up an idol, of more than a chi in length, formed like an armored soldier, vividly lifelike, but its nature was unknown. He gave it to his son, and his son loved it very much.\nThe fellow's son once carried the idol with him to the neighbor's boy to play, imitating an expedition. The idol was light yet sturdy, and all else that touched it fell afoul. The neighbor's boy brought out clay burial figures among others to serve as troops. None could withstand, and he was greatly angered, and abruptly took a hoe to the idol, whereupon the hoe broke and the idol was unharmed. The fellow's son treasured it all the more, always sure to place it by his pillow, thereafter falling asleep.\nThe neighbor's boy told his father of the idol. The father was covetous, and sought to rob it upon hearing of this, believing it to be valuable.\nOne day, upon the city docking in remote regions, the neighbor there entered the house of Li at night, seized the idol and left, to enter the city in his greed to offer it to a noble.\nBefore long, he met a person, who spake: 'To walk at night is very tiring. Rest for a brief while.' He did not answer. Again the person spake: 'The idol in your sack is an infant's toy. I bid you know this; it will not bring you reward, but instead suffer you calamity. You should return swiftly.'\nThe neighbor was greatly startled. He knew he had met an extraordinary one, and could not balk for a moment, only mumbling his assent. The extraordinary one knew his intent, and laughed grandly. The neighbor dared not raise his gaze out of fear. Shortly the laughter fell, but the extraordinary one had thus left.\nThough he feared calamity, he did not return, instead hurrying fast for the city, but the idol in his sack grew all the heavier, and shortly he could not carry it on his back, and dragged it. In an instant his strength was depleted, his mood in great turmoil. Fearful the extraordinary one would take the idol, he thus fell upon the sack, and as he looked all around he wept, and in the end could not abandon it.\nAt daybreak, a merchant passed by, and saw a man lying sound asleep. Before long, he awoke with a start, grasped the sack and spake: 'Do not take my idol!' But the sack was completely empty. The merchant believed him crazed, and left him behind. Thus he was in a daze, returned home, and there fell deathly sick.\nThe son woke, looked all over but could not find the idol, and wept greatly and did not stop. Told by some that the neighbor had thieved it, the fellow of Li sought to question the neighbor, but found him of grave illness, and instead made no question.\nThe townsfolk believed the idol inauspicious, and the son argued with them. And unsuccessful, was angered but spake no further of it. The fellow of Li, fearing his son would walk the neighbor's path in life, sought for it with great care. His son did not become crazed, but began to study forging and casting. Some asked the son of it, and he spake: 'I know the idol is not born of magic, it is the work of real man. I will cast a new idol to prevail over it.'\nThe son grew somewhat older, and forged and cast relentlessly, ingenious of mind and divine of spirit, and word of his reputation reached the capital. A department examined his talent, and weighed him well. He was selected to become a Tianshi.\nFive years later, the son cast an idol, and offered it to all at the Ministry of Works. This idol was fashioned after an armored soldier, clad and equipped full and well, of nature light yet sturdy, and did not rust even when aired to the sun or lashed by the rain. The High Minister was alarmed, and sought to ask of it, and the son told him of what happened in childhood.

Left with no alternative, the Candleholder transcribed the lyrics and let the children return home.\nAfterwards, the Candleholder got in direct contact with local authorities, requesting they bolster security administration and enlist more emergency workers to respond in the event of sudden disaster. At the end of that autumn, a flood broke out in the area. With grain harvests under thirty percent of previous years, it was fortunate that local authorities had long since prepared, and were ready to send in grains from nearby cities, leading to no further unrest.

Her departure had been too rushed to take nearly any personal items. And they should have cleaned out her office long ago. So why save these? Why send them to Rhodes Island? And why now?\nA few days ago, at the intervention of the Maylander Foundation, construction ceased on dozens of unlawful experiment sites. Certain people had bribed officials in the municipal planning department to circumvent the necessary auditing procedures, and used fabricated plans to deceive the ethics review committee. Business as usual. Saria had spent months on the move to find evidence of their illegal dealings—fortunately she'd gotten ahold of Anthony Simon, along with his sources. Ultimately, over half of the test sites shut down had belonged by Rhine Lab. Maybe that was why these boxing gloves turned up now. A warning, or even a reminder.\nThey were hardly the first boxing gloves she'd ever owned. Those would be the ones her father gave her, clearly unfit for a child, which always chafed her skin to the point of bleeding. But she persisted and did as her father told her, pounding her weakness into a sandbag, along with all her *impractical* emotions, punch by punch. Others had minds filled with openings, so one moment of complete disarray was all she needed to shatter their defensive line in a single punch. Saria was never as enamored with fighting as so many other boxers were: for her the skill was simply a means to survive until now.\nUnconsciously, her fingers read the ridged words along the back of the gloves. 'Trimounts Institute of Technology'—she'd once taken part in an intercollegiate tournament with these. She spent many a late night in the boxing club back then, always with a plus-one tagging along. That certain someone wasn't a fan of the sport, nor was she interested in the tournament, but hung around simply because 'varying your environment prevents your mind from getting stuck in certain lines of thought.' She wasn't joking: not much later she proposed the concept of a hand-mounted exoskeletal operating system, based on observation of Saria's own movements. That system was still in use to this day, in the office of Rhine Lab's Control.\nThough they hadn't seen use in so many years, the gloves looked as snug as ever. Saria very nearly put her hands in them, but a slight ache from beneath her shoulder blades held her back—apparently a call to adjust the dosage of her painkillers. The mercenaries outnumbered her in her last investigation, after all: a whole platoon against one .\nIt meant she was gradually getting close to the truth.\nA few minutes later, Saria let go of the gloves, stowing them in the lowest drawer of her temporary desk, and once again picked up Ifrit's latest physical report.","name":"Unused Boxing Gloves","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30125","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_demkni","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"GUA","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_demkni","description":"'The proof underpinning this paper derives from a veritable ocean of experimental data.

He feels—\nShattered.\nThe pain bites at his consciousness, charging straight at its source, and it seems that this wisp of smoke, this tiny flame is his body. No, he remembers that he had once been able to analyze all things in this world, level mountains and lay waste to cities with a flick of his tail. However, his consciousness should not have arisen from the midst of this chaos, for that which slumbers yet sleeps, and naught has changed since. The tendrils of smoke weave their way through the netting, sinking down to the base of the censer, where the wispy cloud swallows him whole. Why do I awaken? Why do I struggle? Why is it that at the deepest part of this tomb-like jail, there is an even narrower cage? His eyes become smoke, and he gorges himself on his own body, letting off a roar of fury at the nothingness before him.\nThe smoke shifts imperceptibly, as if a minute breeze has swept across the chamber of stone. He remembers—\nHumiliation.\nA great hunt, his defeat, the shame engraved on his bones and inscribed on his heart. His fury draws a picture of the past, where the strong were brought low by the weak, ancient time was overwritten by fleeting moment, and gods were toppled by commoners. The True Lung bled before the people, boiling copper and molten gold pouring onto the earth. For three thousand days and nights, smiths chiseled deep ravines into mountains, casting myriad forms of weapons. The altar became a stronghold, and the robes of the devotees burning incense concealed blades of edict divine. Yes, this was the price of such trickery. An incisive punitive strike, a wound that could not heal. The traces of this humiliation still reside in his body, and he plans to use this wound as a mold to cast a sword.\nA flame bursts forth from the censer as if pumped by a bellows, and the Candleholder on guard rings the alarm bell. He raises—\nA blade.\nWithin the boundless gloom, there are still other consciousnesses being born. At the moment, those consciousnesses are not as lucid as he, but they are as he, and they too seek to surface from the depths of this turbid pond. He still remembers how mortals would describe this sort of relationship, and he understands that they will be his... brothers and sisters. He endures the pain, as though his stomach had been split in twain, and flicks his wrist. The cloud of smoke bursts and dissipates, his sword rending apart heaven and earth from within the chaos.\nThe primordial fog shrinks back, and gloomy night becomes brightest day.\nThe Candleholders rush into the stone chamber, and the Imperial Guards surround the tomb layer by layer. At last, he feels—\nFreedom.\nThe smoke rises from the censer in spirals, standing steady on its stone platform. In the depths of its belly, the Feranmut yet slumbers. He feels that his own body has become lighter, as if he has turned into a wisp of smoke rising through a hole in the censer, floating across the heads of the Candleholders and Imperial Guards, floating past the sealed stone door of the mausoleum, floating through the skies above Baizao, towards distant lands.","name":"'When to Wake Up'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30135","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_chyue","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"FGT","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_chyue","description":"Punch, relax, inhale, exhale—breathing out impurities. The breath leaves him like a lingering fog, spiraling through the air for some time. The sky has just cleared after a rain, and the slippery puddles reflect the grandmaster as he practices.\nMirrored movements at mirrored speeds, yet a thread of disharmony can be seen in this mirror image.\nChongyue halts and looks around.\nThe breath slowly forms into a shape with a head and tail—the shadow of a beast. It clings to his feet, eyes glaring like daggers.\nMobilizing his Qi, the grandmaster shifts position and surges forward with a flip. Clouds move and light shifts. The shadow twists, using the surrounding shadows to form a beast tail that threatens to strike him down.\nHe dodges and thrusts his palm, dispersing the tail instantly. But by then, the white fog has grown large. It opens its maw and bares its claws, poised to attack.\n'Hah!'\nWith a cry that shakes the earth, he tightens his fist, gathers force, and unleashes a punch. Wind whips as it connects, scattering the fog, yet it condenses again into a larger and now grayish-black beast, darkening the sun with its form. It narrows its eyes at the 'human' before it.\n'I know you won't give up that easily. Come; be it a hundred or a thousand times, I won't back down.'\nThe enraged beast stirs a wild gale, leaves sticking to it like green scales. It opens its jaws wide and charges at Chongyue.\nHe makes no move to avoid it, taking the full brunt of its fearsome blow. With a push of his palm, he sends it reeling.\n'What words can't convey, my actions will.'\nHe dashes forth, palm now again a fist, and slams down with all his might.\nA dull thud resounds across heaven and earth, followed by a violent roar.\nHe does not stop, instead raining down blow after blow, until the beast can no longer lift its head. Thunder rolls and dark clouds gather, but the beast seems to show slight signs of surrender.\n'A usual sparring would end here, but between us, I must go all out. Apologies!'\nChongyue leaps into the air, his body light as a feather, his fist heavy as a mountain. With a single strike, he punches a hole straight through his foe.\nWith this upper hand, he presses the attack. His fists become palms, then claws—his left tears as his right clutches—and the beast roars, unwilling to admit defeat. But in the end, the fog disperses, bereft of form and spirit. After a while, the sun begins to shine once more. Where the bestial shadow once swept, a sword now remains.\nThe grandmaster picks it up, unsheathes it, calms his heart, and steadies his Qi. A few breaths, and Chongyue paces his slightly quickened breathing.\n'Practicing a new move, grandmaster? It looked mighty impressive.' Two passing soldiers clap in awe, as if they have been watching for quite a while, and only dare to speak when Chongyue is completely finished.\n'It is nothing special.

Her young visitor's arms and legs were hooked into the branches of a tree, her hands grasping some brilliant red fruit, her sharp eyes quite unlike her youthful figure hanging upside-down, and staring at the apparatus in Shu's hand.\nShu laughs, holding the apparatus tight, and says: 'It's rare to see you in the fields. Do you not have schoolwork to mark?'\n'That group of layabouts? Let someone else who cares take charge of that lot!' The child wipes the fruit with her sleeve, gobbling down a bite, its sweet scent clear even from two or three zhang away. 'What about you? You're hardly an ordinary person yourself, so what are you doing mucking about with a Tianshi apparatus for? Can't you decide how good the harvest will be with a point of your finger and a glance of your eye?'\n'And what if I don't have this mystical power you speak of? What if I have simply seen enough to know if the weather will change, or if the seeds will successfully become crops?'\n'You do, though! Look, don't play dumb, I'm asking you seriously here.'\nShu stoops down towards the field, her cloud-like tail slowly sweeping across the chilly crop ridges. These plants had just passed the seedling stage, and would soon join the sprouts that had been brought onto the agricultural plate alongside their fields, gleaming in the burning embers of the summer evening.\n'Springtime drizzles wake the seeds, grain buds dance in summer's heat. Autumn gifts the crops their gold, but they can't stand winter's cold.' She recites this softly, as if reminiscing on the prior night's dream. 'One person's strength alone could not order the myriad grains everlasting. But before I was I, before Shu was Shu, there was already someone who had achieved half of what was dictated in this song of the jieqi solar terms.\n'A thousand years hence, those that came after her created this Tianshi apparatus. It can take on six forms, knows how seeds will develop, can share data between different plates, and can direct Sky Poles.' The little green cube floats above Shu's palm once more. 'Although mine is somewhat different, its functions are still interlinked: whether it is the song of the jieqi or a Tianshi apparatus, they are but manifestations of the power of the architecture of time.'\n'Pah.' A fruit pit leaps into the heavens like a signal flare, its furious rise startling some featherbeasts roosting in the tree, only landing far away a long while later. 'Forget I ever asked. Breaking out some old Shennong cliche again to avoid the question, how boring.'\nThe child leaps down from the tree, walking off along a small path without another look. As if coming to a sudden realization, Shu lightly claps her hands.\n'Could it be that the reason you came... is that you don't know how to use an apparatus?

So that was great.\nAfter setting foot on Sami soil, a Columbian graciously led her to her villa. Snow was falling on the plains, and across it quietly traveled a procession of people, the one at the head bearing flowers plucked from who-knows-where. They all silently followed him, walking towards the lakeside.\nAmongst them, a child slipped and fell to the ground, and Platinum helped them back up, petals falling into her palms as she did. Her mind flicked back to the past, when she was still an independent knight. To fans flocking to give her flowers—beautiful ones, fragrant ones, ones that seemed like they'd last forever. The flower-bearing procession was now some distance away when she had the sudden urge to see who they were giving them to.\nLooming by the lakeside was a deep white altar, all around which they laid the flowers.\n'They're honoring the memory of a deceased hero. The one leading 'em's a descendant. It's a custom of their tribe,' explained Platinum's Columbian hire.\nThey cast the flowers into the lake and began to dance, singing a nameless song whose melody was deep and somber, and they beat a flame alight. Some wept, while others spoke silently mouthed words, pure and reverent light flickering in their eyes.\nPlatinum and the Columbian watched from afar as they shared food around the bonfire, before they drew she herself in. Language failed to connect them, but mood did not, and there she tried a cup of local wine, and was given a red flower by an elderly woman.\n'Too noisy...' she thought. Soon after, the child who'd fallen over pulled her by the hand and merrily spun around, running as he did for the bonfire before bringing more food back.\nShe accepted his kindness, and watched the people before her.\nThe tribe raised the hero. The hero fought Ursus all his life, then died on the border. Countless descendants had come in his memory to tell her, a simple stranger, his story. The story of an escaped assassin, of what was hidden inside a meat pie cut open and swallowed by knife and fork, of a soft napkin wiping non-existent bloodstains and crumbs.\nThe lakeside was a distance from the plains, and the Columbian still stood wrapped in a blanket far away, illuminated by the villas' twinkling lights, waiting for Platinum to give the word to lead the way. Platinum stood by the bonfire, simply watching the people, never saying a word.","name":"Solo Travel Kit","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31044","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30034","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_206_gnosis":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Gnosis","profession":"Supporter","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30031","count":6},{"id":"30041","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30052","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"31033","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31043","count":3},{"id":"30103","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3271","count":5},{"id":"30022","count":8},{"id":"30042","count":5}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3273","count":4},{"id":"30145","count":3},{"id":"31024","count":7}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_gnosis_1","icon":"skchr_gnosis_1","name":"High-Speed Cogitation","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":9}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30145","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_gnosis_2","icon":"skchr_gnosis_2","name":"Zero-Point Burst","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31034","count":4},{"id":"31013","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30074","count":4},{"id":"30054","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_gnosis_3","icon":"skchr_gnosis_3","name":"Hypothermia","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31054","count":4},{"id":"30063","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30084","count":4},{"id":"31044","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30074","count":7}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_gnosis","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"UMD","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_gnosis","description":"In the wake of Kjerag slowly gaining fame, so too have Kjerag's snowcaps become better and better known.\nAmong them, nevermelting Originium ice crystals, as a symbol of sincerity, have become even more sought after.\nSuch ice crystals do exist, but acquiring them is a challenge. Only at the peaks of the most dangerous summits might they possibly be found. Numerous people drawn by the allure have ultimately found themselves leaving empty-handed.\nStill, not a problem for Gnosis. The Edelweisses—once generational guards of Kjerag's archives—would know the Snow Realm better than anyone.\nIn his eyes, the difficulty lies in the climb.\nIndeed, despite spending his childhood years in Kjerag, he much prefers absorbing himself in archives. His family relocating to Victoria only saw him devote practically all his time to studies.\nThus, even after he'd followed Enciodes back to Kjerag, he never once showed any interest in taking on the mountains.\nBut today, he sets foot into them alone, following an ancient notebook as he ascends a remote peak. There, Originium ice crystals wait in silence for their unearthers.\nAs he regards them, Gnosis cannot help but reminisce.\nThe dream was power and prosperity for the nation of Kjerag, but the method of realizing it continually evolved as he studied in Victoria. His ultimate conclusion, he had to accept, ran counter to that future he and Enciodes had envisioned together in their youth.\nWhich was why, he recalls, that as they parted and made their promise, he felt an unprecedented shred of defiance—would Enciodes come to Victoria? And should he, and should the rift in their consensus be impassable, what then?\nIt came to be that Enciodes did arrive. Never had they clashed before, but they knew how each other's ideals had diverged in parts. Even so, with a shared dream in mind, still they firmly took each others' hands.\nAmidst the Snowcap Incident, he thought to play him at his own game, to employ more radical methods to corner Enciodes.\nThought, assessment, hesitance, and thought again. In a desolate corner, idea upon idea spun through his mind. He could do it himself, he thought. In the end, he did nothing.\nWhen in that room they put hand in hand once again, he knew his choice had been foregone.\nIt seems Enciodes has conveyed the Doctor an ice crystal. Gnosis has decided to procure one too, but does not plan to gift it to anyone.\nWith the Snowcap Incident behind them, on this day as banal as any other, he treads alone into the mountains for one thing only—he wants to forge this ice crystal into a sword. A gift for himself.\nThe blade it creates would be useless in combat. Should he ever replace his weaponry, it'll need to be made separately. But that is of no consequence, for he has no plans to fight with this blade. No, it won't even see the light of day. It'll remain hidden, forever.\nThe crystal symbolizes unwavering loyalty. Never has he shown such a thing to Enciodes, and never will he. He will be faithful only to his own choices.\nAnd his choice is—\nThe comms terminal at his belt vibrates. A communications network has been erected across the whole of Kjerag by now.

The attendant's face briefly shows a hint of surprise, then he steps forward to loudly announce the Pasha's decree—\n'Messenger, my lord had never heard of such ruins hidden within the Black Flow, nor of the history buried within Victoria's ancient battlefields. Your stories have greatly pleased him, and he is willing to forge a friendship with Yvangelista XI from afar.'\n'Thank you very much.' The blue-haired Messenger gives a polite and confident Sargonian court bow and begins to turn to leave. But the attendant speaks again, 'Don't be in such a hurry, Messenger. My lord has one more question for you.'\n'Please, go ahead.'\n'My lord wishes to ask if you would stay and tell him the remaining nine hundred and ninety-five stories?'\n'Does... His Excellency the Pasha mean that he wishes for me to relinquish my role as a Messenger, and remain by his side?'\n'Precisely. My lord offers you wealth and luxury here, in exchange for sharing with him all your enchanting stories.'\nThe blue-haired Messenger smiles. 'I thank His Excellency for his kindness, but I am accustomed to my life of freedom; such riches and luxury are not suited to me.'\nThe Pasha whispers a few more words to the attendant, who then steps forward again. 'You are already an outlier among the Sankta. Your kin will not accept you, and your homeland has no place for you. Why go to such lengths on their behalf?'\nThis time, the blue-haired Messenger pauses to think before answering, 'I don't journey for my kin, nor do I long for my homeland. In the beginning, it was an old friend who set me on my travels. Now, I travel out of curiosity for a certain story.'\n'What kind of story?'\n'An old man once told me a story before I left. It was a silly story about everyone eating ice cream together under the sun. But as I traveled, I began to see what was intriguing about it—and as I reflected more and more on it, I discovered even more stories.' The blue-haired Messenger gives another courtly bow. 'You should instead let me travel as far as possible, so that when I return, I may regale you with even more wondrous tales.'\nThe Pasha no longer tries to persuade her, only ordering that, whenever the blue-haired Messenger returned, the palace gates would always be open to her. As they walk out of the palace, her red-haired companion, who had been silently listening all along, finally can't hold back and asks, 'Did His Holiness really tell you a story like that?'\nA smile appears at the corner of the blue-haired Messenger's mouth.

I just don't like things that are a pain in the ass. \nIt's noisy as hell, there's alcohol, wrist wrestling, and inevitably, a little girl named Tomimi always shows up... Any single one of these things in isolation, I can probably deal with. Some, I might even call cute, but when you smash everything together, that's what you call a pain in the ass. I much prefer enjoying a glass of juice alone on the deck to spending a night at the bar. \n\nI'm almost out of juice. \nOne nice thing about being alone is that it's comfy. One not-so-nice thing is the fact that you get bored easily. \nI open up my toolbox with the mod kit and start to do maintenance on my 'gun.' Guess it's one form of entertainment. \nTwenty seconds, it's completely disassembled. \nEighty-one seconds, every part's squeaky clean. \nThirty-five seconds, the lubricant on all the metal parts has been replaced. \nFifteen seconds, the reassembly is complete. \nIf the thing in my hand was the real deal, I'd be able to do a whole lot more with the mod kit. Unfortunately, it's just a weirdly-shaped crossbow that fires a special ink bullet. Doesn't actually use Originium or anything sensational like that. \nSome things only work in the right hands. Trying to force them onto others won't end well. \n\nJust as I was deciding if I wanted to get a second glass of juice, I hear a few other people step onto the deck. Other than the sound of their footsteps, they aren't making any other noises. The people wisely keep their distance from me and stop on the side of the deck. \nBefore long, I hear a soft singing voice from them. I look back, and as expected, it's a group of Abyssal Hunters. \nAs soon as I see the three of them, my heart starts to beat faster. I once told to the Doctor it was love at first sight, though of course that was a joke. In reality, my best guess was that this unusual physiological reaction was probably related to that incident when I was a child. But I've never asked about it, nor do I think about it much. Wouldn't be able to get any answers anyway, and all the thinking in the world wouldn't solve the problem. In the end, I'd just be causing extra issues for myself. \nAnd I have a hunch – it'd be a hundred times more of a pain in the ass than Gavial dragging me to a hundred bars for a hundred nights. \nSo, as long as that thing stays far, far away from my daily life, I'm good. I have no desire to throw myself headlong into something that's gonna be a pain in the ass. \nBut occasionally, every so often... \nWhen I close my eyes, I'll see that person. I have no idea who that person is, but I can tell, they're at the center of this whole mess. \nSomeone wrapped in the smell of the sea, a robed Iberian... \nI stand up and sling the gun over my shoulder, pick up the only toolbox messy enough to be my own, and go to grab my second cup of juice.","name":"Gunsmithing Toolkit","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31024","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30034","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_219_meteo":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Meteorite","profession":"Sniper","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30051","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30062","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30012","count":8}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30043","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30053","count":2},{"id":"30073","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3241","count":4},{"id":"30052","count":4},{"id":"30032","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3243","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":7},{"id":"30083","count":14}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_meteo_1","icon":"skchr_meteo_1","name":"Buckshot","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30064","count":2},{"id":"30043","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"30064","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30024","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_meteo_2","icon":"skchr_meteo_2","name":"High-Explosive Shell","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"30053","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30074","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":5}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_meteo","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"ART","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_meteo","description":"ID tag #1, code name 'Blunt Wedge'.\nThis was her first time receiving a commission as a mercenary.

Right, she's more familiar with these two things than anyone. What were they again?\nRight, a stick and a sack.\nIn a hay pile in County Kevin, the stench of almost-fermenting Originium slug mucus bore its way into her dreams. There came an uninvited, extremely peckish old manglerbeast, dripping saliva over her face. Subconsciously, she took that iron stick and gave its head a fierce drubbing, and that was how she lived to tell the tale.\nOn a gravel road in County Peninsula, a checkpoint soldier dragged her out of the merchant's crate she hid in with such grip strength that her arm might've come off. Quickly and resourcefully, she stuffed her documents between the layers of the sack, and bluffed her way past by pretending she was a vagrant bard setting off into the wilds.\nOr, well, was it a crowbar and bugle?\nIn a mire in Connor County, a mercenary's Arts almost shaved the tree above her flat, and her fortcracker's ammo case chose to be difficult at the exact worst time. If it wasn't for her crowbar being just sturdy enough to lever the case's handle, she'd probably be gone on the spot.\nOn the white sands of Castshire County, a soldier gave her life before she could give any last words, the wounded commandant couldn't sound the bugle, and so the unmarked grave lay deathly silent under the beating sun. At least the instrument she had on hand was able to sound clear enough a tone, such that they could send their deceased comrade off with some kind of a decent farewell.\nRight. These were a crank and a set of bagpipes.\nIt was the biggest tractor of the whole village, and the crank it came with was long as half her arm. The arm she dislocated trying to show off that she could do a quicker job than her mum at starting the engine. Sitting on the tractor on the way to the hospital, though, her laugh ended up luring half the village's burdenbeasts after her.\nAnd the pipes made of young cystybeast hide, downy tartan sewn to it by her mum. The village all knew her unique knack for spinning around while she played them. And of course, none forgot how earsplitting those wistful tones were as they echoed all through the village, back when she'd just learned them as a bairn.\nShame that now, after prying a case and doing in a mangler, the crank's bent out of shape, and won't be starting a tractor no more.

There were tremendous lines at the hypermarket today, and it's already past seven by the time he gets back, with the wuxia on TV long since over. But he leaves it on out of habit anyway, and shuffles over to the kitchen to cook.\nThe meat's red and tender; Hung decides he'll mince it and mix in fresh spring onion, planning to fill two tiers of buns. With the meat neatly stacked on the cutting board, Hung picks up a kitchen cleaver in each hand and assumes the Meat-Chopping Stance, when suddenly a mournful wail comes from the living room TV.\n'You've fallen into my hands, Zhong Dafa! You know your blood debt. It's time you finally repaid me!'\nThe cleaver drops with a bang, not into the meat, but straight into the cutting board. Hung shakes his ears—he only hears intermittent gasps and sobs. With no clue about what's going on, he continues the work at hand. A short while later, he tosses the filling into a bowl, and is just about to pour in a few drops of sesame oil when—\n'Stop, Dacai! You can't kill him! The truth is, he's your brother!'\n'Huh?' Hung abruptly lifts his head in disbelief, face blanketed with confusion, beginning to suspect he just heard wrong. More voices immediately follow.\n'Ma, how can that be? I don't believe you!'\n'When I divorced your ba, we each took a child. We never thought it would lead to a mess like this.'\nHung wrinkles his brows, squeezes the bottle of sesame oil, and barely gives it a single shake, only for way too much to pour out, and the bowl of mincemeat to smell to high heaven of sesame. He heaves a sigh and lays the rolled-out pieces of dough in his hand to wrap the buns, all while his ears stand attentively pricked, as if hoping to catch whatever audible clues the television might make next.\n'Hmph. No need to hesitate, Zhou Dacai. Just do it.'\n'Ma, what do I—what do I do...'\nThe buns he is pleating shut are incredibly lopsided, and he finally stops what he's doing and devotes his full attention to the ensuing conversation. Unfortunately, however, someone seems to have changed the channel, and the TV is now playing video game noises, with Waai Fu and Aak's clamorous voices reaching Hung's ears soon after, followed shortly by the sound of Lee coming in. Hung shakes his head and smiles, and places the uniquely shaped buns inside the already-boiling steamers.\nThe clock's hour hand has been on eight for a while now, and Hung gently uncovers the steamers, the clouds of billowing steam revealing the plump white meat buns before him, as the filling's scallion scent slyly wafts from the kitchen and spreads through the living room, subconsciously luring the people towards it and the table.\nThere'll always be people who say eight o'clock in Lungmen is for the eight o'clock sitcoms, but Hung knows what eight o'clock is truly for—the little round dining table, with his folks sat huddled in a circle.","name":"Popular Sitcom Tapes","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30034","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30024","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_230_savage":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Savage","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30021","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30053","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30053","count":2},{"id":"30073","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":4},{"id":"30022","count":4},{"id":"30032","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":3},{"id":"30014","count":9},{"id":"30023","count":18}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_savage_1","icon":"skcom_powerstrike[2]","name":"Power Strike β","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"30053","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30074","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30104","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_savage_2","icon":"skchr_savage_2","name":"Precise Blast","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"30063","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30084","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30024","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_savage","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"CEN","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_savage","description":"Mum's very cross with the big Cautus girl scratching her head in front of her.\n'Trying to sneak out again!

Rope loves it. It's a treasure of hers, but never her pick. She used to loiter at the display window, making her reflection overlap with the pedestal behind the glass, and like moonlight shines on the water, this choker would sit around her neck. She'd flutter her eyes, and so would the girl in the glass, and in that moment they'd become one.\nBut unfortunately, reflections aren't forever.\n'I bet I looked way too desperate staring at it.

It's the fragrance of tar oil, picked up from its tanning phase.\n'Ahh, that's the smell of wealth—maybe I'll just wear this one for today. Then again, the leather's so soft. What if it gets scraped up?'\nRope cups the choker in her hands, and lightly rubs her cheeks against it, reveling in the sophisticated and sensual texture.\n'You're so comfy. I love you.

I'm discharged and perfectly fine, aren't I?' \n'You think coming out of hospital's the end of it? Your assignment was to draw that Ursus spy out, and I could deal with him myself.

And should you not... then do not be burdened, and go!' \n—This was the parting advice the master of the house gave to me. \nDoctor.

Only once it's wiped bare of all excess oil does she finally take a deep breath, and prepare to put it in her mouth.\n'Wait, give it a rinse in your glass!'\nThe prompting voice from the crowd enters her ears, and she sees the light. Her chopsticks make an about face and dunk the meat in her drinking glass, and instantly, what was clear warm water is now scarlet throughout, beads of oil floating about within.\nThe sight of the meat's original, fair color greets her.

A few massive bookshelves filled the room totally full, all sorts of old books all over them, ancient records from all manner, ways and styles of martial arts. \n'Choose one, learn it. In three months, show it to me.' \nWaai Fu—still not able to read too many words—spent a while hesitating, then selected a book from the shelves caked in dust, with 'The Classic of Hung Mei Wing Chun' written on the cover. Waai Fu had no clue what kind of technique this was, or what characterized it. She simply thought it had a very nice name. \nHer father hadn't given her a single pointer, so Waai Fu had to pore over the books by herself. Yes, she didn't understand the words too well, but the phrases in there—'wicked walks vengeance heady; just employs mind and soul' and the like—flew completely over her head. But she still followed the movements in the pictures, practicing punch after punch, step after step. Assiduous, not allowing an inch of slack. \nThree months later, before her father, Waai Fu finished demonstrating the whole set of techniques, three-hundred-and-twenty-seven moves in all, flowing like nature, not a single one missed. But once her father finished watching, he furrowed his brows and sighed a rough sigh. \n'No. No good. Try again.' \nWaai Fu didn't know why, but had no alternative but to listen. \nOne year later, her father began to take Waai Fu through some simple fighting exercises. He clearly didn't give it much strength, but Waai Fu still found herself caught out again and again, and every time, her father's fists would never pull back as they landed on her. \nWaai Fu didn't understand. Clearly she knew every move by heart, but why couldn't she make fluent use of them? She decided to look within the manual again for answers, and after several times parsing from cover to cover, she finally found, in one unremarkable corner, a phrase. \n'Ways aloft may decree, but man is what makes change.' \nAnd a few more years later, Waai Fu could recite that book in her sleep, the tomes now shelved in a nook of her room, rarely flipped through anymore. In her training, too, her father came to chide her less and less, and she felt he was becoming less strict than he was before. But suddenly, her father left home. He left behind a pair of daggers, and a single phrase. \n'I must go and find something.' \nWaai Fu was unable to comprehend just what could be worth her father abandoning her, abandoning this home, to search for. It was only a few days after that Waai Fu left home too, to live somewhere different. \nWhile tidying her room, she again saw the manual, and offhandedly, flipped through it. From start to end, page by page, it was like her past lay before her. She found, at the very end of the very last tome, clearly written: 'Martiality asks mastery, this only from thorough training. With no purpose and no self, there is no boundary and no end.' \n'You're right, father. I'll catch up to you, and become stronger than you.'","name":"The Classic of Hung Mei Wing Chun","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"31014","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30064","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30014","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_245_cello":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Virtuosa","profession":"Supporter","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30061","count":4},{"id":"30031","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30012","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":4},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30083","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30073","count":6},{"id":"31023","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3271","count":5},{"id":"30052","count":7},{"id":"30012","count":7}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3273","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30104","count":5}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_cello_1","icon":"skchr_cello_1","name":"'Golden Ecstasy'","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31044","count":4},{"id":"30053","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31034","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30145","count":6},{"id":"30074","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_cello_2","icon":"skchr_cello_2","name":"'Requiem Mass'","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30094","count":4},{"id":"31083","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30155","count":6},{"id":"31034","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_cello_3","icon":"skchr_cello_3","name":"'Liberal Tango'","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31054","count":4},{"id":"31023","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31024","count":4},{"id":"31034","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"30014","count":6}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_cello","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"RIT","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_cello","description":"Her tutor seems very late to today's lesson, but the student hardly cares. She's always hated this tutor anyway. Clearly she's good enough to finish this whole cello solo unguided! But somehow, her tutor's just never satisfied.\nCertainly, she can't play as well as her tutor. Oh, she's <i>tried</i> to submerge herself in the score, to converse without care with the composer she never got to know. But those ebon-black markings have stayed silent on their chalk-white scores. Their mysterious composer passed away almost a century ago; they say she died all alone, and practically left no trace she ever lived save for a few of her scores. It's not in her grasp to comprehend the passion and sorrow that lie within each movement, nor does she have a clue who that 'ever-lost lover' hiding with the score really was, or why they were struck by such fits of madness.\nAnd so she can only but play as the score instructs, emotionlessly. At first, it goes well enough. She can still feel the brush of each note, feel them settle in her heart. But as the movements progress, and the music enters its passages of true frothing turbulence, the leaps, the repeats, those elegant trills and appoggiaturas, it all embraces her with fervor. They invite her to a mad dance, but step by step, her gait follows less and less. Tempestuous crescendos and diminuendos barrel violently through her vision, only to slip away next instant to the score's furthest reaches. She tries to catch them, grab hold of each glittering moment that accompanies them, struggling in the midst of the endlessly long staff to the point her strings' tremors can no longer rouse those worked-up emotions, and their place is taken by the repetitious back-and-forth of the metronome, clack, clack, clack, clack... echoing lonely in her ears, until the impassioned music agonizingly lingers no longer, as if this betrayal was preordained.\nAnd thus, the energy fades from her fingertips as does that beautiful passage, leaving only the metronome still chiming away. Clack, clack, clack, clack... This imperfect silence becomes a parting declaration. At this, the fury and despair that lurk in her heart burst forth, becoming the heat in the tears her eyes brim with. Her vision blurs—the plain white score before her bids her final throes of resistance. She snatches the quill, and upon the score engraves each and every leap, every repeat, every elegant trill and appoggiatura, every tempestuous crescendo and diminuendo. Jet-black like cast iron shackles, she knows she's gone mad, but this is the only way she has to bind her ever-lost lover to her side. Before the final barline ends it all, her life will flow with the music.\nAnd this is when the cello grinds to a halt. She finds herself holding the bow, the cello silently resting upon her bosom, and the strings are not quivering, and the metronome is not rocking, and all that fills the chamber is her heavy breathing. And her Sankta tutor, with her black gloves, gently brushes a hand over hers, and speaks in the same soft and gentle tone as ever.\n'Your playing today was perfect,' she congratulates her, content. 'The composer's life, and her love, flowed within your performance.'","name":"The Decrescendo","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30155","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30145","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_248_mgllan":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Magallan","profession":"Supporter","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30041","count":5},{"id":"30021","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30062","count":3},{"id":"30032","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30093","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30103","count":3},{"id":"30033","count":5}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3271","count":5},{"id":"30042","count":7},{"id":"30032","count":4}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3273","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30084","count":6}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_mgllan_1","icon":"skchr_mgllan_1","name":"High-Efficiency Freezing Module","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"30083","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30034","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":10}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_mgllan_2","icon":"skchr_mgllan_2","name":"Laser Mining Module","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30093","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"30024","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_mgllan_3","icon":"skchr_mgllan_3","name":"Armed Combat Module","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30024","count":4},{"id":"30103","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"30034","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"30064","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_mgllan","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"SUM","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_mgllan","description":"First expedition to the endless icefield, 25 days from the closest research station on foot:\nI just dug a tree branch out of the snow.\nThe exact data is in the data sheets, but to briefly describe it, I guess it's about as long as my arm.\nI can conclude it went through a really long petrification process. The one I'm holding must have had 90% of its original volume dissolved away before its petrification.\nWhen you think of it this way, it must have been a very big chunk of wood!\nI guess... it was probably as thick as the trunk of that tree the other day?\nIn that case, maybe the whole tree was as big as the Rhine Lab headquarters building!\nWhoa, that's amazing!\nIt doesn't seem very heavy; I'll try to take it back whole. I only hope that the Ursus police at the border aren't too hard on me.\n\nSecond expedition to the endless tundra, 28 days from the closest research station on foot:\nI'm taking shelter from the snowstorm outside. It doesn't look like I'll get anywhere today, so I'll stay here and try to rest up.\nI'm all out of drones, too. If I'd kept to the plan, I would've gone back as soon as I lost one of my drones.\nIn normal circumstances, I should have theoretically been able to last a month and a half in the tundra, but the situation here is way too brutal. A month is about as long as I can make it...\nIf I don't find anything once the snowstorm calms down a little, I'll—\nHey, you guys know what I found?!\nA field of flowers right inside the cave!\nThese plants get their water and nutrients from the ice here. They don't grow very tall, but they look like they're doing very well.\nI am taking an entire plant back in a culturing jar. I'll do some preliminary analysis back at the research station, and then bring it back to Rhine Lab.\nI'll try to keep going for two more days once the storm is over, then I'll go back.\nIf I act on impulse again, it might end up killing me.\n\nSecond expedition to the endless tundra, 30 days from the closest research station on foot:\nThere is an entire block of Originium ice crystal standing in front of me. Could be three times as tall as me!\nIt's a whole diamond shaped block, so if it wasn't for the snowstorm here, it'd be reflecting light in all directions. That'd look so cool!\nIt's a shame to just let it sit here among the pile of rocks and snow.\nI've marked down its rough location and taken a picture. I hope I'll be able to find it again next time by following the locator beacon.\nGiven the implications of the crystal being in one intact piece, I couldn't possibly have taken any samples from it. Thankfully, there are more than enough shards lying around that I can bring back to analyze. They'll last me a whole year.\nThat's the expedition's objective accomplished. Now it's time to go home!\nI wonder if I'll come across that police officer I met last time.\n\nThird expedition to the endless tundra, 15 days from the closest research station on foot:\nI'm taking a different route this time just like HQ suggested.\n15 days into this route, however, I got stopped!\nIt's an official Messenger from Ursus.\nHe told me there's a restricted military area up ahead and I shouldn't go any further.\nI showed him the expedition permit I got from the Ursus government, their confirmation of my expedition route, as well as the commission letter for me to map this area to show that I have a right to come through here.\nHe wouldn't listen and ordered me to turn back, even claiming he has the authority to cancel these documents on the spot.\nThe words he used had a really strict tone to them, but the way he said it sounded like he was just asking me to leave.\nI have a feeling that whatever lies ahead is definitely worth probing, but I also know it's not a good idea to pick a fight with a foreign official while I'm on an expedition in their territory.\nI told him I understood and gave him a pack of scalecis jerky.\nHe calmed down right away, and said he'd be willing to help me out on my way back.\nAccording to the forecast, there will probably be another huge snowstorm the next two days, so I really welcome his help.\nI may not have been able to complete my survey's objective this time, but the results I have aren't so bad.\nWhat's more, I made myself a new friend.\nThere's some black snow falling from the sky.

Our professor had an amazing reputation, so there we were, waiting for him to enter, introduce himself, and begin teaching—that was a 'class' as we knew it.\nBut once our 'professor' came in, he told us to pack our stuff and follow him. All the students did as they were told, and I was no exception.\nThe whole way, he was telling us about the makeup of Columbia's geology, the manufacturers that made prospecting machines, and various archeological findings, but every time we arrived at a statue or a bust or the like, he'd stop to introduce the next of these historical greats and school alumni that had made outstanding contributions to Columbian expeditionary causes.\nFinally, once he'd made a full circle and brought us back to the classroom, the course's real professor decided to show up. He sent off the old guy, introduced himself to everyone, and then announced that his first class was over.\nYou should've heard my classmates whispering. Was it a prank? Was it some kind of school tradition? Some figured the old schmuck went out of his way to put it on, with all the power he had.\nNot a single person cared about anything he'd just told us.\nNot a one.\n......\nOne day, I was eating lunch by a little brook on campus when I came across the man by accident. Moreover, he seemed to recognize me from back then, and mentioned how I was taking notes so diligently.\nSo I asked him, was he a professor at the school? And his response was no.\n'I just give a little dirty money to the place,' he told me.\nIt was only then that I realized the man in front of me was on the school's Board of Governors.\nHe said he'd retired by now, handed all his property down to his children, and had nothing to do but occasionally come to the school and stroll around.\nHe asked me what I planned to do in future, and I said I was going to be a scientific explorer. 'Nice. You do that for a couple of years, then you retire as a senior consultant for some non-profit environmental org. Good plan, young lady.'\nI said I planned to remain an explorer, until I was physically unable to. It seemed the moment I finished saying that, something in his eyes lit up.\n'Then I wish you luck, explorer. Once you get results... remember to come back, you hear? Tell the next generation the story of their predecessors.'\nThen he left, just like that, and we never crossed paths again.\nBefore I actually took on this career, I thought the whole thing was just a governor giving a student some words of encouragement. However, now I totally understand the hopes, and the expectations, that those words entailed.\nNobody ever made a scientific achievement in one shot. People like to only remember talent, and attribute everything to miracle-workers.\nBut history is very, very long, and filled with all sorts of people giving everything they've got, all so one subject or another isn't forgotten and left behind.\nOur lives are finite, and the new generation's always learning from the ground up. It falls to us to keep accumulating and synthesizing, endlessly, to lay the bricks for those who follow us.\nI don't know if my findings will be enough to change this land.\nI just know that whatever I discover will be passed on to whoever comes next.\nThey won't need to fall where I fell, or bleed where I bled.\nThey can go further than I did, see further ahead.\nEven just the tiniest step can be enough to make new history.\nThat's the day I look forward to.\n—Magallan, foreword to the Instructional Soaring Dragon Drone development files","name":"Instructional Soaring Dragon Drone","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30145","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_249_mlyss":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Muelsyse","profession":"Vanguard","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30031","count":6},{"id":"30041","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30052","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"31013","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30063","count":4},{"id":"30013","count":5}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3211","count":5},{"id":"30022","count":10},{"id":"30012","count":6}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3213","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30094","count":5}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_mlyss_1","icon":"skchr_mlyss_1","name":"Progressive Moisturization","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30093","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31064","count":4},{"id":"31054","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30145","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_mlyss_2","icon":"skchr_mlyss_2","name":"Ecological Interaction","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"30033","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":10}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30155","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_mlyss_3","icon":"skchr_mlyss_3","name":"Superficial Regulation","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30084","count":4},{"id":"30013","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"30094","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30074","count":7}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_mlyss","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"TAC","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_mlyss","description":"In the early morning, long before the staff of the Ecological Section have come to work, a figure strolls through the vivarium.

Thus he carefully strokes its finely sheened fur, the sunset that lingers on this kitten soaking into his fingertips. \nHis smile supplants all other mood in his vision; the performer has long since had a fine name in mind for his unusual new friend, and merely has not given it yet. \nHe has decided, if this black cat keep coming forevermore, he will ask her: would you like to walk with me?","name":"Miss Christine's Felt","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30135","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_phatom","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"EXE","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_phatom","description":"What is death?\nThe teachers described it thus: dramatic, unexpected, shrouded.\nA character's death was artistic, and by and large the play's climax.

My health hasn't been too good lately. The doctors say it's because of overwork and so on, so I have to recuperate, and I'm not allowed to go and look after the plants. That's why I need you to take over some of the Convalescent Garden's work. I'll write what you need to do underneath, and if you're not sure about anything, you can ask Miss Lena to teach you. I'll recover as soon as I can, so I won't keep you for too long.\nBefore I introduce the work to you, please take a look to the right of this letter. There's a pouch with floral teabags, and some tasty little snacks. They're all for you, to say thank you. Go on and have them while you read below.\n\nYour daily work will involve the following:\n1. Temperature logging and warning. Each greenhouse entrance has a terminal to control the thermoregulatory equipment. You just need to check each day if the figures are normal or not, that's all. If the equipment's giving a warning, then report it to Miss Lena as soon as possible, and she'll help you solve the problem.\n2. Operating the lighting. The Garden's lighting systems are all unified under PRTS control, so you don't actually need to worry too much, but just in case it's not working properly, you'll need to operate them manually, and adjust them into the correct positions. I've drawn detailed directions on another sheet, so make sure you look over that carefully.\n3. Plant irrigation. You can leave most of the plants alone, and the greenhouse will sprinkle them at the same times each day. The schedule should be stuck to the door, so don't go inside when that's happening. There's some other flowers too, the ones in my studio, and I'm really sorry, but all I can do is ask you to take care of them for the time being.

A current pulls at her, trying to drag her into the ocean's depths. \nSkadi does not resist. \nGradually, the light fades from her vision, the environment around her becomes pitch-dark, and the pressure around her continuously increases.

People, so many people, arms spread wide, roaming through the night, freed and at peace.\nSkadi does not swim into the sky. She is sat on the shore, silently watching the scene before her, gentle waves at times caressing her boots. Her sword, ever her companion, rests by her side. On the other, there sits a girl dressed in a red dancer's dress. She wears a broad hat, behind which Skadi cannot see her face. She has hair as soft and white as her own, and so Skadi feels she is close, familiar. Like any other dream, this one has no beginning. By the time she realizes she's dreaming, she is already sitting there.\nThe girl in red speaks. 'Are you a hunter?' she asks, voice ineffable and captivating.\n'Yes.'\n'Do you like to hunt?'\n'I can't say I like it. But terrifying creatures are always threatening my kin. Someone has to fight them.'\n'To defend your kin's lives, you must hunt other races?'\n'Possibly. Maybe.'\n'But then, why can we not all become kin?' the girl asks, sincere.\n'Is everyone kin, where you are?' Skadi replies.\nThe girl seems to ponder carefully for a while, then nods.\n'We don't need to hunt each other, in the place I am.'\n'Then what do you normally do?'\n'I do nothing. I sing.'\n'It sounds like your home is more peaceful than mine.'\n'It is just as you see now.'\nThe girl extends a slender finger, pointing far away. At the edge of vision, the line separating sea from sky is given a formless end. All life blends together, no difference, no distance.\n'Goodbye. I have to go.' Skadi takes her sword and stands.\n'Are you going to hunt?'\n'I have to wake up. Once I do, yes. I'll carry on hunting.'\n'I hope that one day, you can be free of this destiny.'\n'If possible.'\n......\nWhen Skadi dreamt this dream, she had not yet left Ægir.

I cursed my fate. I took my rage out on the prisoners around me, and even the guards. I once treated these chains and spikes as weapons.\nThey've hurt so many others in my name, and I in turn have received plenty of wounds of my own. But my fury never diminished, not even the slightest bit. All I could feel was it burning ever brighter, ever fiercer.\nUntil one time I awoke from being beaten into unconsciousness, and the doctor treating me said that she felt I was a very weak man.\nI thanked her from the bottom of my heart.\nSince that day, I began to show restraint. These chains and spikes were no longer used to harm others, but instead to defend myself, as well as those who could not defend themselves.\nI began to earn the respect of others, even gaining some small amount of freedom within that prison. But I was the only one who knew that my burning rage had not yet flickered out. It had simply stopped growing. It continued to torment me in the dead of night.\nHowever, it was only because of this that I felt I was able to walk forwards, and the meaning of these chains and spikes gradually changed once again, becoming the means I used to keep myself in check.\nAfterwards, these restraints of mine followed me to a pharmaceutical company. There, I still habitually wore them, but they had become nothing more than a set of work-out equipment. There were even people there who thought they looked stylish, and learned to make their own for fashion.\nIt was there that I spent an indescribably beautiful period of my life. However, once news of my parents' deaths reached my ears, a question arose in my heart: why had I decided to restrain myself all this time?\nWas it for that singular moment when I could finally release my rage without reservation? Or was it for a moment when I could finally let my hatred go?\nNow, with my parents dead, and those that framed them also dead, the suspicions on me have been washed clean as well.\nMy fury sputtered out, my hatred died down, and I was truly free.\nBut I was not happy. The moment the Hyde brothers died, I felt nothing, because I had no idea what to do with myself.\nHowever, once I felt the weight of these chains and spikes on my body, I suddenly came to realize—\nThese bindings are the price I paid for my freedom.

A row of dazzling knives reflect a blinding light. He retrieves a lively finfish from the water tank and slaps it a few times against the chopping board, its movements soon ceasing. He then takes out knives of different shapes and sizes and in turn, removes the scales with a small knife and slices open the belly with a large knife, each step orderly and neat. He shakes the complete finfish around in his hand a few times, and it turns into several different parts, neatly placed upon the table. \n'It seems complicated, and that's because it is.

When the first astrology study was published, aircraft had yet to leap into our skies, and Columbia wasn't even born yet. Scholars across generations have observed the starry sky day after day, and after every Startide, they would gather and process the complex data they received, overturning conclusions. There was only one thing keeping them going: the belief that our lives were entwined with the distant stars.\n'With today's technology, we can identify many errors in their past writings, but be it from the perspective of an astrologist or a historian, their meticulous records are still an incredible achievement. Perhaps we now believe that such ancient theories should be put to rest, but the hole above Trimounts is not the truth itself—it is a door we can all peek into. As a bibliography consultant for Rhine Lab, I know well that, be it through shared experience or objective inference, Casters of astrology and scholars of astronomy have always shared the same goal. It would be unfortunate to abandon our predecessors' research. If astrology says we can never truly understand the stars, then as a scholar, I will continue our search through the scientific method. But if there comes a day when science also fails to grasp the secrets that lie outside the dome, astrology may yet offer us a new possibility.'\n......\n'Is there something on my face, Elena?'\n'Do you still remember, Sia?

Try not to stuff too many things in there. \n\n––Henry Arizona","name":"Surgical Instrument Kit","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30054","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_277_sqrrel":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Shaw","profession":"Specialist","rarity":"TIER_4","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":2}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30021","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30032","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30042","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30093","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30103","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":45,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":60,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3281","count":3},{"id":"30022","count":1},{"id":"30012","count":1}]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3282","count":5},{"id":"30063","count":12},{"id":"30033","count":11}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_sqrrel_1","icon":"skchr_sqrrel_1","name":"Steam Pump","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30014","count":1},{"id":"30093","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30034","count":2},{"id":"30014","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"30064","count":2}]]},{"id":"skchr_sqrrel_2","icon":"skchr_sqrrel_2","name":"High-Pressure Water Cannon","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30024","count":1},{"id":"30103","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":2},{"id":"30024","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30125","count":2},{"id":"30044","count":2}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_sqrrel","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"PUS","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_sqrrel","description":"'...highly customized protective module, for a fireproof experience that can't be beat!'\nCatching the commercial coming from the shop, two people in the Lungmen Fire Department gear slow their pace as they pass the display window.\n'Annoyed because your not-so-ordinary horns puncture your protective layers?

It is difficult to identify the age of an Oni, but she carries a bamboo naginata on her back, indicating that she is still a musha in training. Our florist has a secret rule: Oni are not allowed inside because their actions are uncouth, and if they are not careful, they will destroy months of the flower arrangers' efforts in the blink of an eye. We are justifiably cautious, as we never know if they might have the support of their kin from the underworld behind them.\nThere is an alley on the other side of the florist, and misbehaving students use it as a hideout. They demand money from their frail and weak classmates, throwing them to the ground or stomping on them. This Wednesday evening, I saw a little boy with a backpack run by the window with a sullen, tear-stained face and a bruised nose. On Thursday, he passed by this place with the Oni, but soon turned back alone and squirmed back into the alley. \n On Friday afternoon, I was helping the master arrange flowers when I saw people squatting along the side of the street with water pipes, wine bottles, crowbars, and the like. Before we could call the police, the person they were waiting for arrived. The Oni musha accompanied the little boy from school just like yesterday. When they got to our window, the little boy suddenly began to pick up his pace, and the teens who were bullying him quickly surrounded him. \nThey were almost ready to kill the Oni. The Oni's bamboo naginata managed to block a few blows, but was broken into several pieces by their sheer brute force. \nThen, that was the first time I saw an ‘Oni.’ \nThe Oni musha who had lost her weapon raised her fists, tearing through metal with her bare knuckles, smearing her own blood in the eyes of her opponents, lashing out with her knees and feet when her fists were blocked, striking out with her horns when her legs were restrained, biting with her teeth when her horns were blocked. When the whistle signaling the police's arrival came at last, only one was still standing – the Oni. \nShe wiped the corners of her bleeding lips emotionlessly, like the legendary man-eating fiends of lore.

The professor and student mentors haven't shown any symptoms—which is to say, ordinary contact with an Infected, and even treatment of them, likely doesn't lead to infection at all.\nWhich lets me confirm that I was only infected because I made contact with Originium while it was in an active state.\nAs for the active Originium's origins: Was this region already polluted by Originium?—Unlikely, because the professor and student mentors weren't infected. Was it my contact with Infected blood?—Not impossible.\nI can be sure that Infected blood carries traces of active Originium. If so, I need to distinguish whether the areas I contacted at the time were open wounds, how long the contact lasted, the freshness of contacted blood, etc. For all factors.\nIf there was a wound, fresh blood was contacted, and contact was prolonged, I can hypothesize resultant infection was inevitable; if there was a wound, stale blood was contacted, and contact was brief, would infection occur? This can determine whether or not Originium activity in the blood of Infected wanes as time passes. Also, if there was no wound and fresh blood was contacted; if there was no wound, stale blood was contacted...\nUnfortunately, I don't remember the exact circumstances.

Now, little crabs, where are you......' \n...... \nA few hours later, the pink-haired Sankta returned to Beanstalk with a breeder box, two little metal crabs rolled up into balls inside. \nIn a box behind her were three fowlbeast eggs of different colors. \nBeanstalk got her metal crabs back, and Ambriel received the exquisite music box, so beautiful that one dared not handle it with anything more than the gentlest of touches. \n'I can't believe it.' Ambriel thought to herself while joyfully looking at the music box. 'I can't believe all that equipment ended up being so useful even off the battlefield.~' \n'Um, excuse me, were you planning on hatching those?' Beanstalk pointed to the fowlbeast eggs. 'If you want to hatch fowlbeast eggs, you'll need an incubator, and you'll have to turn them over frequently...' \n'Is it that complicated?!' \n'P-Please don't just throw them out though!

That is, until she turns the corner to a Swire branded lipstick counter.\n'The usual. Five #38 Bullets. Thanks,' Swire masterfully asks the salesperson for her favorite lipstick.\nThe #38 Bullet has been her lipstick of choice for the past ten years. Naturally, the price is of no concern to her.\n'Of course, Miss Swire. Right away,' says the salesperson, who seems to be familiar with this process herself. She asks a coworker to take over at the counter and disappears into the storeroom to look for the lipsticks the princess personally requested. Before long, she returns with a wooden carton and hands it over to Swire.\n'Please confirm this is the correct amount.'\nWithout opening the box to check its contents, Swire merely acknowledges the salesperson and looks down to fish for something in her handbag.\nAfter a good while, she takes out a mini bag. To everyone else, this probably looks more like a petite handbag.\nShe unbuckles her bag, revealing five black velvet slots inside.\nIn each of those slots is a used up #38 Bullet lipstick.\nSwire removes her used lipsticks and places them on the counter before inserting four of her newly purchased lipsticks in the slots, with the fifth one going into her pocket instead.\nWhen she notices Swire placing her bags back on her shoulders again, the salesperson's heart begins to race.\n'Miss, would you like someone to help carry your bags?'\n'Oh? No need. They are hardly heavy at all.'\n'Frightfully sorry, but are you sure...?'\n'Yes, I'm sure,' Swire answers as she walks away from the counter. It seems she really needs no help with her bags.\nShe may not need any help, but there are others who need hers.\nNot a moment after she steps out of the shopping mall's front doors, Swire hears a loud scream for help. She turns to the scream's direction to find a thief dashing away with a woman's handbag in his hands.\nIt so happens she is running right toward a superintendent of the L.G.D.\n'What a coincidence,' Swire thinks to herself.\nBy chance, she does not have her flail with her.\nIt so happens she just bought new lipstick today.\nWhat's more, there is one right in her pocket right now.\nShe decides to teach the thief a lesson he will never forget.\nSwire sets her shopping bags down, takes out her lipstick and removes the cap, breaking the seal, and waits for the thief to come closer.\nA few seconds later, everyone in the vicinity hears a thud, followed by the thief's wail as he stumbles to the ground under the L.G.D. patrol officer's roar.\n\nSeveral minutes later...\n'Good work, Missy. You're off duty, and you still caught a thief for us.' Hoshiguma, here to oversee the arrest of the thief, forces a smile as she greets Swire, the brave good Samaritan.\nNormally, Swire would personally take the man in herself for interrogation.\nHowever, she has the day off. This case isn't hers to deal with.\n'This fellow has got to have some real rotten luck to run into me today.'\n'It's not every day someone bumps into an off duty inspector when they go to snatch something.'\n'Hmph, whatever. You take him in. I'm going home. I'll deal with the case tomorrow.'\n'If you say so, Missy.'\n'Before you go, I have a question for you.'\n'What is it?'\nSwire turns around to find Hoshiguma writing something on her case report.\n'What should I write for how the suspect was taken down?'\nSwire can tell that Hoshiguma is asking for her opinion.\n'Just write down that it was lipstick. There is no need to pull punches for someone like him.'\n'Ahaha, okay then,' says Hoshiguma as she cheerfully scribbles on her report, 'The suspect was taken down by lipstick.'\n'I don't even want to head straight home anymore. Why don't you hurry and finish up with work? We'll get dinner together.'\n'Would you like me to escort you home and carry your bags for you, Missy? Haha.'\n'Oh, enough questions. Hurry up already.'\n'Okay, give me a second. I'll give the report to somebody else, then we can get dinner.'\n'Be sure to tell me how amazing this lipstick of yours is.'\n'Certainly.'\n\n'Why don't you carry my bags for me now?

If only we were in Kazdel, we'd have our people, we'd have food and drink, and most importantly, we'd have a place to settle. Most of the squad were Leithanian locals who had joined the Mudrock Squad there, and a few were old members who had been with her since Ursus. It used to be that most drifted between a few settlements near their homelands—taking odd jobs, or scrambling in mercenary groups to scrape up some business. Nobody had been to Kazdel before, but their homesickness for it was united in its fidelity, every bit the real thing.\nWe must cross the mountain range before dark, Mudrock told them at dawn before they set off. They crossed a rugged plains, damp vapor enveloping them, the mountains growing hazy and blotted in their shrinking sight. Heavy beads condensed upon every wild, virid blade of the sloping meadow, steeping them in mossy hues, bowing them in dejection. The weary squad trod upon weary grass, the future that faced them only more wearisome still. Beyond the mountains floated a great black cloud, a sign of the torrents to come. Rapidly, thick fog fell from the high heavens to rest between the peaks, shrouding their summits, only drops of snow-white visible—if that—in the haze. All looked to Mudrock, their silence asking her: What do we do?\nShe came to a towering cliffside, and called softly to those friends who never once spoke. As if answering in harmony, the stern rock delightfully parted by Child of Soil and Stone's request, then reformed, and all now found a simple yet comforting alcove before them.\nAs night fell, those sheltered in the cave found the rain yet to abate. Hoping their pursuers would be tarried by it too, one spoke half-jokingly—if only we were in Kazdel. I hope it'll be firm enough for us there, sturdy, just like this place our leader made for us, actually.

At the street corner where the structure above him collapsed with a boom, Bison caught a dessert that almost hit him in the head in his shock. The grand church briefly stole away his senses with its splendor under the sunlight. Soon after, he pushed the door open, where the Legati were sat to capacity inside.\nColumbia. The never-resting pioneer cities gave him a profound respect for humanity's sheer vitality, and the bleeding-edge science made him pore over every clause and turn of phrase in the contracts all the more carefully.

He crawled up to the window, and made a rough note of the lyrics.\nSiracusa. The sandstorm in the barrens tore the map he was holding to shreds, and Bison had to make it to his destination bar going by the lights alone. He pushed the door open, and the three Lupos inside fell silent. He coolly handed over the goods and info, and turned a blind eye to the cold glint of a firearm peeking out from under the blanket.\nYan. He's back somewhere familiar, and familiar too is the party that awaits him again as he enters. Bison recalls his surprise last time candy rained down on him from all over, but now he sees the chaos before him and simply takes the shield his redheaded mentor hands him, now in a very peculiar form indeed, making it hard to tell its original design was of his father's own style.\nHe uses the calm and coolness he's trained on the journey thus far to look as unflustered as possible, but all the charm from across the land flashes across his brain in an instant. Mixed with the music is an explanation to the rough tune of 'We were running a delivery and hit a snag, so we just grabbed it to save our hides. The mods were to make up for that.'\nBison accepts it, this present from his father, and plunging through the tunes and the scent of apple pie, he makes his way to the bar counter and begins to write a reply.\nTitle, greeting, main body. He inquires about his father's health, and writes of how his recent work has gone. He lifts his eyes to see champagne flying at the face of some unknown gang's goon, and Bison swiftly tucks the letter into his pocket and raises his shield.\nIf one day, he could take complete charge... on one hand, Bison is trying to reckon with what all these bells-and-whistles modules are even for, and on the other, his mind is looping the thought that he's going to make this place run like an orderly, regular business for just one month!\n...No, dream bigger!

Inside was a small handful of the season's grains.\nIt was a tiny tradition of Landen Monastery's. Hildegard had seen her seniors off to far away lands with much the same thing. The clerics would pick out the best of the monastery's wheat, thresh it with great prudence, then dry the grains and place them into a hand-sewn pouch. They held within them Landen Monastery's fine character and glorious mission. It was said they blessed the Landen Guard in times of tribulation.\nHildegard and her senior clerics had discussed this legend's origins more than a few times. Some held that the grains could serve as emergency rations when in desperate straits, but others held their own views. Legend also told of a great Landen soldier who used the wheat he carried on his journey to brew a batch of beer, and brought a safe source of hydration and protracted merriment to villagers whose water had been polluted.\nAll told, wheat was a wonderful thing. Bread and drink, more often than not, came from it. It symbolized an enduring hope. Whether the people longed for luscious joy or a peaceful life, they would find it in these grains.\nHildegard had always held the same, too, until she passed through an ancient battlefield on her journey. The Landen Guard had faced the enemy on it some centuries ago, and she'd once read how bitter, how fierce the campaign was. She'd thought it'd be a wasteland covered by the stench of grief.\nBut no, it was now a field of wheat.\nThough a field of wheat, it seemed altogether inappropriate. The wheat growing here had no farmer to tend it. It sprang high over the plains, filling her view. It was the harvest season, and the golden ears glittered brightly in the downing sun.\nHildegard gripped the pouch in her hands. She understood. This field was born from the blessing she held in the heart of her hand. It had been nourished by blood.\nShe suddenly recalled the pet name the clerics of Landen Monastery gave these pouches. 'Seeds of Tomorrow.'\nHow would tomorrow turn out? Nobody knew. Maybe the same as ever, or maybe stained in tears of blood. But with these seeds in hand, there would be beauty in the end, sprouting from whatever became of them, even if it was watered by hardship.\nHildegard carefully stowed away the pouch of tomorrow's seeds, to grow again one day.","name":"'Seeds of Tomorrow'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30115","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_archet","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"MAR","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_003_archet","description":"During her years of wandering, Hildegard had visited many cities across Terra and witnessed all manner of wonders. One day, she happened across a small village near Ursus, which was almost completely isolated from the outside world. The residents here had never cared about things like faith or future, working tirelessly only to fill their stomachs. But in this village, there was a young girl who knew the history of the Landen Guard and remembered the teachings of the Lateran Pope, as her grandfather had fought alongside the Landen Guard in his younger days. Although these experiences had long since turned to old memories, and the old memories simplified into bedtime stories for a little girl, their power to promote belief in salvation had not waned. In the eyes of the little girl, Hildegard's arrival fulfilled the promise of salvation in the teachings and prophecies. So, during that harsh winter, as the little girl lay dying, she implored Hildegard to give her a Lateran funeral, using her one and only precious glass bead as payment.\n\nHildegard prayed quietly for the girl, according to the teachings of the Lateran:\n'When this land disappears, so too desire disappears. But those who serve the will and purpose shall have eternal life.'\n\nSince embarking on her journey, Hildegard has been collecting stories, artifacts, and legends left by the Landen Monastery and Guard, organizing them into a notebook. It contains an old medal purchased from a destitute wanderer, a strange Sarkaz bedtime story about the Landen Guard, and even a review of cystymilk bread by a famous food critic from the Yan.\n\n'Like in a certain story my father told me when I was little, no matter how far you wander in the forest, even if you lose your way, as long as you follow the breadcrumb trail you left behind, you can always find your way home.'\n\n'But in the story, aren't the breadcrumbs eaten by a fowlbeast, leaving the boy lost in the forest forever?'\n\n'Uh... Anyway, what I mean is that as long as those who need it hold on to faith, the story will survive alongside drinking and merriment. No matter how far you've wandered, Landen Monastery will always be there if you are willing to look back. It's all worth commemorating.'\n\nThis is where Hildegard's optimism comes from. Although she has imagined several possibilities for the future of Landen Monastery, whether it is forced to close due to poor management or destroyed in the chaos of Terra, the greatest challenge is that the ideals and functions the monastery represents are no longer needed by the people, or even the Lateran. But despite such worries, and despite disappointment and setbacks time and time again, she has never stopped.\n\nThe teachings of the Lateran tell us what we see is not that which we see, it is what we do not see. It is the unseen that is eternal.\n\n'Of course, I think if we compiled the collected stories and legends about Landen Monastery into a book, we just might be able to... raise some more money!'","name":"Yesterday Once More","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30145","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30125","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_004_archet","cnOnly":true,"typeName1":"ISW","type":"A","icon":"uniequip_004_archet","description":"空弦已获得特别认证许可\n根据外勤部门决议\n在集成战略行动中以改良策略应对敌人\n特别颁发此证章\n以兹证明\n“洞穿恶徒胸膛，让正义与光芒永留其间。”","name":"空弦特限证章","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1}]]}]},"char_333_sidero":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Sideroca","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30011","count":10}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"31023","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30073","count":3},{"id":"30053","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":7},{"id":"30062","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":3},{"id":"31014","count":9},{"id":"30043","count":13}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_heal_self[3]","icon":"skcom_heal_self[3]","name":"Regeneration γ","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"30103","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30074","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_sidero_2","icon":"skchr_sidero_2","name":"Restorative Surge","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30054","count":3},{"id":"31013","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30084","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"31024","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_sidero","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"AFT","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_sidero","description":"'Thou shalt love Corinia.' Thus reads the inscription that crowns the stone pillar marking the city's gate. Its carver must have pictured that all those departing the city would read it the moment they lifted their heads. Now, though, stallkeeps and mercenaries throng the gate as tightly as packed fins, and those who look up will see nothing but smoke-stained graffiti and billboards. These used to be Sideroca's stomping grounds as a child—she'd watch aging mercs grumble as they waited to find employers, snippets of their words helping her piece together a map in her head—the map she'd use for her escape plan one day.\nIt's been years since then. She's returned, here beneath this gate once more. The branch director who'd referred Sideroca to Rhodes Island is here with her now, touring the old haunt together and talking about old times. The director confesses that back then, more than anything, she'd rushed to sign up Sideroca because she didn't want to let a talent like her go anywhere else. Sideroca had that little something extra compared to your average drifter. Real recognizes real, so to speak.\nA freight boat needs a ballast to sail, and the wandering mercs and merchants of this citadel need something spiritual to weigh down their legs, lest they be trapped behind the mountains. Sideroca was barely an adult when she found her legs, firmer ones than any merc drowning their life away in booze. So what did keep her so rock-steady?\nShe doesn't have an answer right away. She scrutinizes Corinia once more, this city built on the idea of an eye for an eye. She can't stand the place in all its dark, bloodied glory. It sickens her how the books you learn to read from here teach you all the different names of money. She despises how children play pretend by copying the way grown-ups haggle and bargain and use each other for their own gain. To her, Corinia is one giant example of what things shouldn't be. With every step, she's reminding herself: don't end up like this. Don't end up like the merchants who peddle fakes beneath the gate, or the mercs who cry ripoff and smash their stalls up.\nA crude rock can be carved into pillar decorations or boat ballasts. Yet, if you price it as a jewel and cling to it, you'll waste all your energy and sink to the river's bottom with it. The further Sideroca travels from her homeland, the more clearly she understands this and many other things.\nShe has no interest in entering the city itself.

She could easily lie, of course, and tell you she believes.\n'It was the castle itself,' Iris says with almost no hesitation. 'I dreamt of it when I was quite young. It was grand, full of different rooms, each one filled with towering cupboards, all specially made. They could lock away time itself, and nothing would ever rot or fall apart inside... And because of that, I'd never lose anything beloved to me ever again. After I awoke, Grandmother made that castle I dreamt of into a pop-up book, and I kept it safe. Later on, she took me to the castle, and shockingly, it was exactly as both my dream and the book. And that book went into the very first shelf of the very first room. It was then that she asked me, you know, if I'd be willing to serve as the castle's master, and bring help to all the children.'\nJoaquin is sure Iris isn't lying; he's confident in his observations after being with Rhodes Island for so long. Even if what she says is so... unimaginable. She doesn't think herself a cheap conjurer—she *is* the creature in the magic trick, dwelling in the realm of fairytales. Joaquin supposes that's why the children aboard all trust her. As he speaks, his hands are still busy helping her stow away the sweetie boxes and toy models by size.\n'Sorry for bringing up something so pointless, Miss Iris.'\n'Your necklace there...'\nJoaquin looks down at the silver star nestled in his chest, now tarnished into an entirely different color over the years.\n'Mr. Joaquin, you are your own Castle.'","name":"Castle Pop-Up Book","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31054","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30104","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_340_shwaz":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Schwarz","profession":"Sniper","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30021","count":5},{"id":"30051","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30032","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30042","count":4},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30073","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30083","count":3},{"id":"30103","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3241","count":5},{"id":"30032","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":6}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3243","count":4},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":5}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_shwaz_1","icon":"skchr_shwaz_1","name":"Charged Shot","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30094","count":4},{"id":"30073","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30024","count":4},{"id":"30104","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"30034","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_shwaz_2","icon":"skchr_shwaz_2","name":"Sharp Eye","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"30083","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30034","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":10}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30064","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_shwaz_3","icon":"skchr_shwaz_3","name":"Final Tactics","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30093","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"30024","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":6}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_shwaz","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"ARC","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_shwaz","description":"'Freeze.'\nDeathly as ice, the splitting roar hits a young man's ears.

Schwarz is stood on the rooftop, looking down on him coldly.\n'Oripathy put me out of work everywhere! I'll starve to death if I don't eat any longer!' Schwarz's eyes seem to pierce through him, and in a flash, anger overtakes him. 'You're Infected too, aren't you! Why can't you just let me go?!'\nSchwarz is silent for a moment, then gives a faint sigh. 'Because this is the only way you get to keep living. Also, if you can't find work, you can come to Rhodes Island. Give it a shot.'\nThe man is startled for a spell the moment his anger abates, already beginning to feel rueful.

She'd never been treated unfairly for her own disease.\nBut no doubt, she was an Infected too.\nShe used to always accompany Lady Ceylon as she fumed, wait until she'd calmed down, and then brew her a cup of black tea. Lately, she's realized she sort of gets Lady Ceylon now.\n'Schwarz, did you catch the thief?' Just as she's barraging a local with geology questions, Ceylon sees Schwarz has come back, and waves excitedly at her.\nShe nods, and is there by Ceylon's side in just a few short leaps.\n'Schwarz, I've just heard about a group of homeless Infected banding together to attack passersby.

Nor respond to any questions pointed at her. A considerable headache for the squad's strait-laced captain, who promptly placed the child in Beeswax's care and left to pursue the fleeing slavers.\nThe captain in all his extroversion likely felt awkward about it, but Beeswax did not. Once she realized the child had no intention of speaking, she turned her attention instead to the jungle, fresh and verdant.\nAfter stepping away for a while, she happened to notice the girl staring at her horns. The two made eye contact, the girl immediately averted her gaze. They repeated this a few times, and then Beeswax moved to speak:\n'You can touch them, if you're curious.'\nThe girl's eyes opened wide.\n'I'm not lying.'\nShe hesitantly stood up, approached Beeswax, and cautiously, nervously reached her arm out, as if a timid fowl was on her hand. She gave the lightest touch.\n'So pretty...'\nSomething Beeswax had heard from many a horned or antlered operator before. It embarrassed and flustered her at first, but she learned in time to reply with a 'yours are wonderful, too,' as was polite.\nBe that so, the sight of the Elafia rescued only moments ago from slavers—soiled, undernourished, even missing a chunk from her antlers—drove a new response to her mind.\n'I can make yours just as pretty. Okay?'\nMarch's spring breeze still carried a chill. The young Elafia sat on the ground. Beeswax cleared the tangle of dirty cotton from her antlers, then took out a care kit. A gauze to wipe the stains away, then a soft brush to clean the dust out from the crevices where the bone forked.\nThe Elafia lowered her head, screwing her eyes shut, as if she were taking part in a solemn ceremony of sorts.\nOnce the cleaning was over, Beeswax took a sanding block and a small file and worked patiently at the dried-out keratin of the Elafia's antlers, before applying a layer of essential oils with due care. All done, she brought out a miniature length of ribbon from her kit, and tied a small bow upon the antler's break.\n'There we are.'\nBeeswax passed the girl a pocket mirror.\nThe girl shied from looking at first, but eventually, she stole a glance, before finally fixing her gaze on it, eyes wide open.

With her outfit all together and a thrice-over in the mirror, she took her papers and tools with her, off to what was now her position in the Rhodes Island Medical Department.\nIt was an uneventful day. She got seated at her workplace, met Atro and the rest of her colleagues, set up her itinerary, went to a meeting, ate lunch, wrangled all manner of IDs, confirmed the laboratory she'd be using, ate dinner, chatted with Professor Kal'tsit, and went to read in the library. That was it, sunup to sundown.\nHowever, a subtlety to Kal'tsit's actions weighed on her mind. When she looked at Folinic, her eyes seemed inadvertently drawn to her cravat. Folinic had met with Kal'tsit several times throughout the day, and almost every time she did that, as small as it was, to the point she'd thought she was wearing it wrong, and that was how Kal'tsit was opting to notify her. Yet when she got back to her dorm and stood in front of her mirror, she found the cravat still tied neat and tidily upon her chest.\nIf something was wrong, Professor Kal'tsit would've mentioned it on the spot, Folinic thought. She untied her cravat, then tied it once again.\nSo, what exactly was the issue?\nFolinic puzzled over it, and in short order took it off, only to put it back on slowly this time, once again remembering how her mother taught her to tie it—\nA choked gasp escaped her throat before she covered her mouth. Folinic was a very disciplined person, but at this very moment, she was losing control over herself.\nShe tried to hold back her voice, but managed only to sob in heavier, more broken fits, almost suffocating.\nEven standing up straight felt beyond her, and her hands could barely brace against the table before she fell to the ground, where she curled into a ball.\nRationale? Wisdom? What use were they?\nAching—weeping—these were all she had left.\nA pain that a single night could hardly quell.\nHow long must it take, until you finally move past losing family so close to you, and all the inexhaustible grief—how long until you finally forget?\n......\nAt dawn the next day, Folinic came to on the ice-cold floor. She wiped her tears dry, went to the bathroom, and ran a cold shower. As the bracing water struck her back, she planned in her head to open up more possibilities in her own work.\nJust before she left, she picked out a jet-black cravat for herself.","name":"Mother's Cravat","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30094","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31014","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_346_aosta":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Aosta","profession":"Sniper","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30031","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30012","count":8}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31023","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3241","count":4},{"id":"30062","count":3},{"id":"30012","count":4}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3243","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":7},{"id":"31023","count":10}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_quickattack[3]","icon":"skcom_quickattack[3]","name":"Swift Strike γ","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30094","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_aosta_2","icon":"skchr_aosta_2","name":"Shadow Nails","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"30093","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":3},{"id":"31014","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_aosta","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"RPR","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_aosta","description":"The night streets of Locomotiva City are teeming with armed thugs.

All suspects are now in custody, and all hostages have been rescued and are currently receiving hospital treatment. Based on facts previously made available by the police, the syndicate responsible has been active in this state as well as our three neighbors, with a focus on hijacking and kidnapping. Seventeen cases this year alone have been linked to them, all striking panic in the populace. Working across state lines to follow developments in the case, Homeland Security employed disciplined units under a single chain of command to finally put this malicious gang behind bars. Justice has finally been served, and the citizens' lives and property safe once again.\nHowever, this week some have continued raising doubts about the police announcement, claiming that credit for the breakthrough goes to a young officer from the auxiliary forces, who is presently unnamed but has captured public attention in recent days. Following the end of the case, footage from a number of mall cameras has circulated on the intercity net. They show a young Perro female in a city police uniform but without a badge hopping onto the furniture store's roof from a nearby building, marking the start of a one woman chase—and eventually brawl—with the gangsters, lasting a whole forty minutes, and ending with her pacifying them all before law enforcement arrived bizarrely late to the scene. The young woman in the video is exceptionally athletic, making use of furniture from every room of the house to contend with the gangsters, skillfully enough to leave many wide-eyed. In the most viral clip, eight of them have her surrounded with edged and bolt-loaded weapons, then in the blink of an eye she grabs a mysterious weapon—said by the store's owner to be no more than a steel chair whose unique design struggled to sell—after which she subdues all the gangsters in short order. The public will not be forgetting her heroism any time soon.\nIn response to these inquiries, law enforcement official have stated that despite her nonstandard uniform, the woman in footage was in fact a special agent they dispatched to the precinct to secretly tail the gang, with orders to take action from within and subdue the criminals. The idea that the footage shows a 'vigilante' or 'police nonfeasance' is categorically false, and rumors that their department and the criminals were 'in cahoots' are not only utterly baseless, but 'harmful to police image.'\nIn contrast, eyewitnesses report that after singlehandedly taking down over a dozen gangsters and freeing the hostages, the mysterious young woman was promptly arrested and taken away by police. Some have even identified her as possibly the valorous officer who rescued a number of people during a major Originium safety accident last year, and exposed the former mayor's misdeeds. Law enforcement officials have yet to comment on this. We have made a request for this 'special agent' to come to our station for an interview, which the police have refused, citing her current hospitalization.","name":"D32 Steel Chair","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"30013","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":20000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":15},{"id":"30033","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":25000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":5},{"id":"30083","count":6},{"id":"4001","count":30000}]]}]},"char_348_ceylon":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Ceylon","profession":"Medic","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30041","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30062","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30083","count":2},{"id":"30103","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3261","count":4},{"id":"30042","count":4},{"id":"30052","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3263","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":7},{"id":"30053","count":10}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_ceylon_1","icon":"skchr_ceylon_1","name":"Concentrated Hydrotherapy","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30024","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_ceylon_2","icon":"skchr_ceylon_2","name":"Water Blessing","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30034","count":3},{"id":"30014","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30034","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_ceylon","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"WAH","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_ceylon","description":"On a hospital corridor bench, a student reading a book sits side by side with a middle-aged woman of professorly airs.

She's withdrawn but decently polite, seems to be a well-raised young lady, but none of that's what he's really focused on.\nNo, Chiave's started noticing her because she keeps coming to the garage, but she's got nothing to fix. Not just that, but she keeps walking over to him, asking him questions about work. She struck him as the annoying sort of amateur, the kind he'd just say a few words to get off his back. Later, though, something made him change his mind about her: a customer came complaining to his boss about how Chiave installed vertical jets and sprayed graffiti on his car without permission while fixing it up, and filed it all under repair costs. The girl made herself known at that point, said she thought Chiave's mods were super sick, and even footed the compensation for him.\n'Huh, this chick's got some taste,' was Chiave's mental comment.\nOne day, she shows up in front of Chiave again, this time with a fancy cake for him. He wants to refuse her, but she says, 'I'll get fat if I eat too much cake, so I may as well give the rest to you,' pushing him to begrudgingly accept it. He's surprised to find, though, that he's had this kind of cake before, and it's his favorite. He's got a million thanks for the girl, so he decides to get her a precious gift in return, the likes of which have never been seen before. He explains his idea his buds—Broca and Aosta—and asks them to help out. Broca's naturally on planning and prototyping duty, and Aosta's not so convinced by Chiave's proposition, but reluctantly designs the exterior and gives input on some of the finer details, while Chiave himself handles the imagination bomb he's throwing down in the making of it all. Finally, after working several nights straight, the three's masterpiece of blood and sweat is ready to see the light of day.\nThe next time the girl visits the garage, everything plays out as they envisioned. With music playing that Broca put on in advance, Chiave (with some effort) presents her with the gift, and recites his speech: 'You like it? It's a jack I made especially for you!

Lucky someone else noticed early, covered it in black, got hands on him. Recipient aside, only people who'd even look at that whistleblowing shit on the wall were those drifters on the ground floor. He got a sudden case of conscience, wanted to warn them. Ngong gau!\nYou know how it went after that. He used his color-changing and slipped out while the brothers on guard weren't watching.

'Tis only natural that I help here!'\nSo spoken, with more than half the ladle still filled, Saga took it into her steady hands, and turned and went for the mountain's shade.\n\n'Truly, what a fool.'\nA gust of wind blew by, cloud and ink scattering, the mountain path long and unending, and all trace of the old man had vanished.\n'Foolish and naive, but devout and sincere.

Returning to her senses, all that surrounds her is no different from how she recalls it. The burdenbeast carved of wood by her fellow disciple still leans against the old camphor tree, a little black tuskbeast pressed against it, polishing its tusks.\nThe rough, frayed strands of the bamboo hat's brim brush past her forehead, carrying the familiar smell of damp fiber. Saga is mentally startled, for the monk who paces before her is none other than her head priest. She hurriedly gathers her mind and corrects her posture, but her stiff back forbids her from standing up fully straight. When she first descended the mountain, the young Saga reached only to the head priest's shoulders in height, and now, she is stooped and decrepit by the weight of a hundred springs' rainshowers and a hundred autumns' falling leaves, and once again stands no taller than her head priest's shoulders.\n'Head priest, this humble servant of...'\nThe old head priest seems to pay no mind to what she was to say, and simply twists his head, signaling to her to move her legs, then unceremoniously thrusts out a mop. She can only drag her heavy legs, trembling shakily as she avoids it, while stammering in her perplexity. The mop's handle, Saga recognizes—it is the wooden pole with which the head priest fought her in the past. Only, for some unknown reason, it is now wrapped in cloth and given a new life cleaning floors.\n'This... This foolish disciple is ashamed, yet I still have doubts for which I must seek answers!\n'I travelled on the outside, and it has been a century at present, yet here and now, it seems to grow ever indistinct. When I first descended, I had thought clarity and sense to be given for all things, and indeed the realm abounded such that it eluded me, but in every place all still had answers to seek, and so in the scrolls of Master Dusk did I linger for ten turns of the year, and still felt naught but wonder.\n'Yet afterwards, that sense of which I believed in lost all sense. The more I saw, the more I felt that the people and the matters of the realm were all of the same single cloth. Our lives in the realm are no more than a mirror, perhaps reflecting oneself, or others, with color then drawn from every part that paints itself over the figure in the mirror, to mend, to make up, and no more. People paint that mirror full, so dense that no light passes, and believe they comprehend good and evil through, veracity from falsity. I sought knowledge and pursued learning for a century, and here in the end, I ask thee lookest within the bag of my travels, and see all I have obtained is dirtied mirrors. I do not understand. If the state of the realm is all but so, then where can Reason still be found?'\nOnly once Saga has finished speaking does the old head priest cease his handiwork and lift his head to answer: 'If you are a burdenbeast, then you can find it.' Thus he ends, and without waiting for further remark from her, he raises the mop, and strikes straight for her face.\n\nIt is afternoon when Saga awakes from her dream with a start.

Standard crossbow bolts were stuck in targets, two or three armor-piercing bolts were stuck in the wall, and several shattered targets bore the signs of explosives. The operator in charge of the field had never seen anything like this before and ran off to report up the chain, leaving Toddifons to tinker with the bolts out of spite.

The craftsman answered the questions one by one, and relieved a lot.\nIt seemed like the volcano wouldn't erupt today, he thought to himself. So he sat next to Toddifons, watching her adjust the siege crossbow and fire a new bolt that lodged itself dead center in the freshly-replaced bullseye. Just like before, Toddifons pulled out the bolt, looked at the target with disappointment on her face, and walked back to her weapon.\nThen, before the craftsman's eyes, she threw the bolt like a spear. It shattered the target and embedded itself in the wall of the testing field.\nAfter throwing it, Toddifons stared at her supervisor with her hands outstretched and an unusual look of helplessness in her eyes.\nIf left to her own devices, Toddifons might be stuck here until the end of time, but the craftsman had a better solution.

She remembers; her tenth birthday is very soon. Surrounding her are adults as frigid as ice, one by one forcing out a smile. She is a smart child, and knows these people mean well, but she's only a child all the same. The adults tell her that her mother is entrusting her to Rhodes Island. Her mother has left, like a cloud.\nShe comes to in brand-new bedding. She remembers; her arm is filled with bruising. She used a stolen sheet of sandpaper to rub at her once-smooth skin, hounding the flesh as though it'd atone. It hurts, and she dares not continue, but the moment she thinks of the black crystals, her throat is in the death grip of an all-choking emotion. She wants to vomit. She can't. She hasn't eaten in so very, very long.\nShe comes to the boom of floodwater. She remembers; Amiya and the Infected are still below. Those nameless heroes are resisting a mere Catastrophe. She lifts her head, and as the elements batter all, it suddenly strikes her that suffering is not a matter of great or small, and nor is hope. She throws herself down. Amiya must be alright, at the very least. She hears those behind her howling in fear. She hears them. Infected are drowning here, they say; when the flood recedes, will their water sources be polluted?\nShe comes to beneath a sunset as red as fire. She remembers; she saved a great many at Sugar City, a great many more than she could know. Her mother comes to mind. All at once, she feels sad, yet smiles. She understands her father, but still hasn't been able to find her mother. Can she find her? Will she ever? As the thought strikes her, she has a mild headache, but feels unusually unburdened.\nShe turns her head, and gives the great Feline as badly wounded as her a tremendous chewing-out. 'Blaze!

He has only ever seen their faces on a couple of group photos.\nWhile apparently this is not at all uncommon for children born on board Rim Billiton's mining ships, it isn't something one would consider normal, either.\n\nLike many other Cautus children, the boy is very active and tends to get into trouble every now and then.\nIt might therefore be hard for those who rarely visit the library to imagine him pouring through the books on technology his father left behind.\nThe most likely source of this habit is an erudite old man with whom he is not related, who has always kept him company and reprimanded him since he was a child.\n\nWith such an unusual guardian, the boy had some perfectly natural questions for someone in his position.\nWho were his parents? How did they die?\nThe boy does actually have a vague idea. He long ago learned from the books what the equipment and instruments his father was standing next to in the photo meant.\nThe boy is much more delicate than he appears. He is worried that perhaps the reason that no one ever mentioned his father until he broached the subject is because his father had put everyone in danger with a work accident. That they avoided the subject so he wouldn't feel guilty.\n\nThe erudite old man can see that the boy has his misgivings. However, he had promised Alisha that he'd take care of her child, that he'd never let him choose the arduous path that his father once walked. That he'd never tell her child that his father spent his last moments selflessly entering collapsed caves to rescue strangers that didn't believe him, under the guise of conducting a post-Catastrophe inspection, and that he'd keep him from thinking that his father was to blame for his mother's final days in depression.\nHowever, there was one lie that the old man cannot bring himself to tell the child. He doesn't have what it takes to tell the child that his father wasn't a hero. As the ship's former Catastrophe Messenger, the old man cannot help but take pride in the young man who found himself here after being framed in Victoria, but nevertheless dedicated himself to fighting Catastrophes.\n\n'But, Alisha... Didn't you name your child Leonhardt because you were hoping he could be like his father...?'\n\nPerhaps it is the fate of his bloodline at work, but the boy could not be dissuaded from studying to become a Catastrophe Messenger.

Her workbook lays open to the side, strewn with soundly proofed notes of all the bits she had no idea of (or the wrong idea).\n<i>It's time you slept...</i> Her falling eyelids give her a nudge.\nAnd so, just before going to bed, she stuffs everything she needs for the exam tomorrow in her bag, peeks over her shoulder, and flips her daily scheduler open. What she'll be up to each day, sorted neat and tidily in here—a habit she picked up from working at Quercus's. Procurement, punctual opening and closing, running inventory, cleaning the shop... With so much to do—none of it trivial—on top of frequent and ever-urgent surprises, having everything she needed written out gave her no small relief.\nHer schedule for tomorrow runs as follows:\nMorning\n(7:30-9:30) Exam time!\n(9:30-10:30) TA for Intro to Originium Arts Theory\nNoon\n(12:00-13:00) Help out at hairdressers\nAfternoon\n(14:00-16:00) Practice a bit at training grounds/tidy up plant nursery for Lena (ask first, might not be today)\n(17:00-18:00) Help out at hairdressers\n(18:00-21:00) Help out at bar\n(21:00-22:00) Reading break\nSusie stares and thinks.

But as for what's in store for her from now on? That's definitely a conversation her tutor can help with.\nThese days, she's gotten the static that once exploded out of her a little under control, and—though hardly anyone notices—she's already started using little tricks from her casting course in her hairdressing. A tactical dab of electrical charge here and there for even swifter, cleaner haircuts.\nAnd all, so that one day—\nSusie leafs forward through the scheduler a little, and stops. Out in the midst of all these untouched pages, there's one event, a single note that's been written long, long in advance:\nSend money to Mum\nMum keeps telling her she doesn't need to do anything of the sort, but she can't help wanting to send something back home. And this is about when Mum'd always send her money too—somehow, it's become their unofficial way of letting each other know they're still well.\nSusie flips the scheduler back to tomorrow, and gives the freshly filled-in cells a few strokes of her fingers.\nShe's a grounded person. She knows that whatever far-flung future she's imagining, it's not her life in the here and now. She likes to give each book a proper read, do each job well, catch each opportunity when it comes. Imagination's a volatile thing, after all... Still, her current everyday, her life aboard Rhodes Island, is one that so clearly rewards her for her efforts, and isn't that precisely what she's wanted all along?\nSo she corrects that item a little:\n(20:00-?) Have a talk with Theory tutor about upcoming course\n<i>That's</i> what she should be asking.\nTime to turn in now...

Each of the heroes, seemingly just as young as them, had a shiny and glowy Originium blade and could use super-awesome techniques that made the whole screen flicker and shine like crazy, and it got everyone watching all pumped up. But then Shamare, who's always so cold, was there all alone like 'that sword's obviously just a toy' like she didn't get the mood at all.\nBubble wasn't one to say much about weapons, really. Swords were all light and fragile, and they'd never beat the cool stuff like giant axes and hammers.\nBut when she saw the friends she'd watched the film with get together one day and bring swords out, that really drove her nuts.\nThey were just like the ones in the movie! The shininess, the little button, and the dashing-ness that exuded from her friends when they lifted their swords to the air and yelled out the super-awesome move name.\nAnd like that, a need to HAVE overtook Bubble's heart.\nShe couldn't steal anyone's—she'd been scolded enough times already for that—but she had no idea how she'd get one like that for herself.\nBy buying it? How? From who? With what? She didn't even know how many rooms were inside this metal plate box, not to mention her friends were telling her they got shipped in from Kazimierz and she can't buy one now.\nWhy can't Bubble get the thing she wants?! It was all her mind could dwell on, but here she is now, and she doesn't know anything, except that aside from stealing someone else's she's got no way of getting the toy. But the lessons she's been having lately, and the sense of morals educated into her, stifle her urge to snatch one.\nSo now Bubble can only storm around in a huff, carelessly knocking into things and yelling loudly to vent her discontent. On occasion, when she tuckers herself out, she hides away in her dorm, crying as she hugs her tribe's totem.\nThis helplessness weighs down on Bubble very, very hard.\nMorte tastes this morsel and shares it with Shamare. After getting the rough gist of things, Shamare seeks out a psychological consultant operator at Medical, and very soon thereafter, a message is sent from HR out to Sargon...\nToday is Bubble's annual 'See Papa Day,' in which her father has agreed to come visit her once a year. It's the most important day of the year to her (aside from her birthday), and Bubble forces herself to shape up and look strong, to meet Papa with a smile. Even still, once she sees him, the gloom in her heart all spills out as tears, and she can't even put her words together properly, only lie in her Papa's arms and cry away.\nAfter the tears are done, she jumps out of her Papa's embrace, and sits silently on the couch again. And surprise! From his rucksack, her father pulls out a toy sword.\nIt's in this instant that Bubble's eyes shine like stars.","name":"Bubble's Shining Sword","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"31043","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":20000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":15},{"id":"30063","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":25000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":5},{"id":"30093","count":6},{"id":"4001","count":30000}]]}]},"char_383_snsant":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Snowsant","profession":"Specialist","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30021","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31013","count":3},{"id":"30043","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3281","count":4},{"id":"30022","count":4},{"id":"30052","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3283","count":3},{"id":"31014","count":8},{"id":"30043","count":15}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_snsant_1","icon":"skchr_snsant_1","name":"Barbed Clawhook","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"30063","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30084","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_snsant_2","icon":"skchr_snsant_2","name":"Telescoping Electric Net","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30054","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_snsant","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"HOK","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_snsant","description":"Inventory of spare change inside Snowsant's money bank:\n- Several metallic arcade tokens from a Lungmen peddler, in lieu of actual change.

Operator Purestream took on the cleanup task all alone after only a day of her job, and she'd spent two whole days inside the filthy inner filtration system... blockages in a few specific areas were the 'main culprits,' all the 'treasures' we'd accidentally lost and couldn't find. I remember Purestream sort of shyly smiled when I told her thanks, and she just urged me to 'take care from now on,' giving me a precautions while she was at it.

The urge hit her out of nowhere to tell them that Iberia wasn't nearly the seaside place most thought of it as, but had vast and arid lands to its name as well.

'To clarify, I've never been back to the sea before, and don't know much about the Ægir. Like you, I've never been to Ægir itself either. I may have been born an Ægir, but what I know is sandstorms, misty dawns and thick jungles, the dry inland—less so the coral on the coast. When I was still young, I went out into our desertified lands with my mother, using bioengineering to treat it with technology. When we had downtime from our field work, she'd fly toys like these for us to run after. There wasn't any kind of special significance to it—it was just a pastime.'\nShe thought back to her home soil of Iberia. The Profound Silence was merciless in revising their place in the country, especially after the Inquisition 'visited' their doorstep to forbid the family from 'spreading dangerous Ægir technology.' As far as most Ægir living in Iberia were now concerned, 'Ægir' was no more than the name that branded them, and ever more vaguely at that.\n'You already had bionic technology this developed back then?'\n'What you see here is actually a successor model I made recently. It now has the propulsion capacity to 'float' in quicksand, and... also some flaws.'

The founding of trade enclaves represents the first time in a century the Sami have opened borders, Columbian caravans and corporate engineer teams becoming frequent guests at Sami's frontier. Ever since she was young, Pudding's frequently gone with her parents to Sami, headed for that ancient land. \nIce and snow blanket the earth wide, sunshine spilling over and refracting, as if a realm paved full with gems. But this is only one corner of Sami. \n'On the tundras of Sami far from civilization, in the forever hibernal Fjal Vetrtonn, most Sami by far still carry on their millennium-old ancient way of life. They're far removed from the Columbian enclave, indifferently surveying all from the Fjal Vetrtonn and bone-chilling winds. Time freezes upon their skin,' says the Sarkaz owner of the coffee shop. 'Don't you want to go deeper and see? See the sights of those tundras and mountains, how the Sami get along with nature in the wilderness.' \n'Am I allowed to?' Pudding hesitantly asks. 'I'm not sure if they'd welcome a city person like me...' \n'Sami does not defy its own fate. We know what it faces, and know how it will respond.' \nAnd so Pudding signs up to join a local supporting construction project, departing early morning one day, going with the team of Columbian engineers into the Myrkwood that she once only gazed at from afar. \nIn the primordial woods, the Sami steadfastly distance from modern technology. Only one subset, a wetland settlement near to the autonomous region, is willing to receive the Columbian engineers' help. \nConstructing a base station, connecting cables, turning on the village's first bulbs... Pudding stares at the faint lights, and the grin of satisfied wonderment on some Sami faces, and it suddenly hits her just what technology means to these people. \nBut it's only in places more remote still, where the true secrets of the Sami lie, a land the Columbians cannot pry into. \nPudding's vacation will be over very soon.

Inside it was her carefully blended green-orange blossom scent. It was thanks to this aroma that she didn't get motion sickness on her way here.\nThis time, she and her coworker were dealing with a gang of fugitives, and the man before her was the leader of the entire group. She wasn't skilled in close combat, but the job was urgent, and the commission generous. They had forced this weapon into her hands, expecting her to report various performance and parameter details after the operation, as if it were only natural for her to use this weapon to kill the Sarkaz before her.\nHe hung a stolen knife from his waist and disdainfully displayed the winding scars on his forearm. She did everything she could to appear unmoved, but her heartbeat quickened.\nShe saw him draw the knife and adopt an aggressive stance, but she suspected it could be a feint. Then, he swung the blade. She made the correct judgment at the last moment, assuming a stance, but she was still too slow. Her weapon had already been cleaved in half.\nBefore the next strike came, she proactively threw herself to the ground, crushing the earring in her hand.\nShe caught a strong whiff of the orange blossom scent and was certain that the Sarkaz smelled the same fragrance. So she looked up to see his expression change from ferocity to confusion, and finally, there was even a touch of softness that contrasted with his face. His lips marred by scarring twitched, hesitating. If there had been enough time, who knew what words they might have uttered.\nYet before they could, she leaped up, driving the half-blade into the Sarkaz's chest. His eyes widened and he fell backwards onto the ground.\nShe pulled the half-blade out of his chest, warm blood splattering her hand.\nSuddenly, she felt like crying, as if she had just killed a close friend she had spent years with. But that wasn't true. She only smelled a fragrance.\nShe had already determined its effects upon concocting it: low concentration for alleviating motion sickness, high concentration to induce a false sense of relaxation and intimacy, a means to save herself in critical moments. The Sarkaz didn't know any of this; he believed there was some forgotten history between them, which is why he died by her blade. However, she knew it was just hormonal fluctuations induced by the drugs that got him killed. Not only did she know this, she also knew that in another five seconds, after the scent of orange blossoms had completely dissipated, the false emotions would vanish.\nFive seconds passed quickly.\nAs expected, she was no longer sad; she just started to detest herself.\nBecause she remembered that the earrings were a gift she had given herself on the day she joined.

Day after day, she would sit out on the balcony, spinning candle wicks and stirring hot wax.\n'Miss Candler, is that you—'\nUpon hearing the name 'Candler', Entelechia subconsciously pulls on a thread of blood, drawing forth trembling fake ears made of hair and fur—the usual motions Candler made when she was listening.\n'Not making candles any longer?' The old man calling for her is an old customer of Candler's. The man looks at her, then at the clothes drying under the sun on the balcony. 'Oh dear, you sold off your workshop.'\nCandler was an artisan of wax and wicks, the candles she crafted scented and elegant. Someone once told her being a candlemaker didn't require any sort of skill. You could simply repackage ones from the factory as handmade ones, after all. But she sought out a teacher and learned what she could of the craft.\nHer teacher once said that no matter the time or place, there was always someone lighting a candle. Some to grieve a death, some to celebrate new life, while others simply eager to read a salacious scene from a book. Candler quietly coughed, saying she was once a sickly child and did not have much opportunity to travel. If possible, she would instead travel through the medium of candles, to witness the customs of every corner of the land.\nFrom then on, she would recreate the candles her teacher had mentioned, one after the other. From the candles of Sami hewn from split logs, to Leithanian candles with their Originium crystal fiber wicks. By the time Entelechia's mission was complete, and there was no longer any need for the guise of 'Miss Candler', there was only one type of candle she had yet to make: the rose candles of Gaul, for times of mourning.\n'*sigh* I still think about your candles. Without them, graveside visits feel so empty.'\nShe looks at the old man, his ears bereft of any hair or fur. He knows not any Entelechia, but he has always remembered the false persona of Candler.\nA sudden thought strikes her: was Candler truly false?\n'I do have some spare time today, sir. I can make you one last candle. But I will be making one in a new style, if you don't mind.'\n'Thank you... Thank you, Miss Candler\n'Do you know anyone growing roses? Let us first borrow a flower, then prepare the other materials. Imagine the petals are little boats floating upon the wax, slowly fading away, day by day...'\nAnd so, one ordinary evening, the candlemaker who longed to travel the land finally recreated the last candle she knew. Entelechia carried on with her mission, while Miss Candler passed away peacefully in this small town, leaving no regrets.\nAnd in distant lands, behind a string of missions and target names, many more such brief lives and identities await. Entelechia is happy to eventually embrace each one and bid them farewell as they wither away. Though these lives serve as mere guises, arduous means to lofty ideals, they are, above all, her own.","name":"A Ferry that Withers","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30135","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30155","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_4011_lessng":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Lessing","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30021","count":5},{"id":"30051","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30032","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30042","count":4},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30033","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31083","count":4},{"id":"31013","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":5},{"id":"30012","count":12},{"id":"30022","count":5}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":4},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"31084","count":5}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_lessng_1","icon":"skcom_powerstrike[3]","name":"Power Strike γ","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31084","count":4},{"id":"30023","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":9}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_lessng_2","icon":"skchr_lessng_2","name":"Clash of the Faithful","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31054","count":4},{"id":"30083","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30084","count":4},{"id":"31044","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30145","count":6},{"id":"31014","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_lessng_3","icon":"skchr_lessng_3","name":"Oathbreaker","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"31063","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31074","count":4},{"id":"31084","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30155","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_lessng","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"DRE","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_lessng","description":"The youth wraps the untied bindings once more.\nThey were bound into thick layers, concealing the heavy sword—though it could hardly be called concealed, given its size, and its outline was clearly visible even completely covered. Its crossguard was wider than most people's arms, and its blade longer than most people were tall. The sealed sword showed nary a hint of edge, and while it was unable to kill in this state, the sight of it was enough to send a shiver down anyone's spine—perhaps this was its purpose, perhaps the youth who carried the blade did not wish to take anyone's life. He simply wished to have a sword, for merely having a sword was itself a message to his opponents. That a bloody death was at hand, that all that it would take was to remove some flimsy bindings—so do not remove those bindings.\nThis really was what the youth thought. He deliberately wrapped his sword in bindings, hid its edge, concealed it, placed it where no one could see it. The blade required patience. Patience could avoid wearing it down, patience could avoid bloody carnage. Yet even if you remain patient for years, even if you placed it where no one could see it, it would still show its one true use at a glance. And so the youth treated the sword this way, just as the youth treated himself.\nHe said 'I am the sword, I am its cutting edge, but I must be hidden away and concealed.' He used to carry himself as such, taking his anger, his torments, his suffering, his joy, his excitement, his inspiration, and burying them within the thick layers of bindings, body and soul both stretched taut.\nBut now, it seems like everything has changed.\nEnemies appear from all directions—though it could hardly be called appearing, for the youth had already imagined them deep in the dense forests of Einwald, below the rainclouds of Sturmland, within the great lakes and rivers of Wasserland, entrenched atop the mud and stones of Erdenherre, their silhouettes doing their dealings amongst the spires, darting between the palaces, the academies, and the mansions. So these were hardly a surprise to him, but he simply did not expect today's situation. When a time comes where push truly comes to shove, might he find that he can no longer see their faces clearly, or know where they were? The enemy is not yet at hand, yet he knows that they are everywhere. He had clearly bound the wrapping in thick layers, yet why did he feel so exposed these days? He had anticipated, prepared for this day. Had known it would come. Fremont had already warned him earlier: this is a battle you chose yourself.\nIt is a battle I chose myself, the youth thought, his sword sealed anew.","name":"Blade Seal","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30145","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30135","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_lessng","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"DRE","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_lessng","description":"Lessing is coming!

So, off Lessing went on his journey... only for him to be subject to quite the odd series of events. As you'll see—\n1. The Liches have never been so eager to invite me out for food. Did they screw up in front of the old man somehow, and now they want me to deal with it?\n2. The Liches scrambled to get me a whole new set of clothes.

On the other side, the young Liches trembling and cowering in the corner, asking in a quiet voice, 'S-S-So are you destressed and decompressed now...?'\nLessing looks at the panic-stricken Liches, then casts a glance at the presents strewn all about the floor, and now, finally, it clicks in his head what today was all about.

And wind came forth in great gusts, and rolled over Her shoulders and Her back, and through the interstices of Her fingers, howling as it did. To the people of Kjerag, this wind would be felt a colder one.\nThen wind's howls turned to chaos, its tight shrieks ushered to fray by words of somnolence, as a song rent and shattered over a million risings and settings of the sun and flew about Her forever. So the chatter grew and grew in the air, till it reached out with a black thorn. And a black raindrop hung upon the thorn's tip, and it seemed that it would fall to the land, and fall betwixt the mountains and the trees, and see that the mountains and the trees would become of its likeness. It was cacophony, and it was infinitely hostile, and it heeded no disobedience. This was Danger.\nSo She thought to stir, yet She found it now took considerable energy, which it had not done before.\nThereupon She forged into the snow of a million suns, and She sought as if seeking the tail of a threadmade cloth, and about Her finger wound a tail of this thread. And so the air changed in its flow, and the snow flew to the air by Her will, and thus was woven a curtain of it. And She put this curtain to the black rain, and drove it from the land at Her feet, in the manner She had done countless times before.\n'Kjarr? Kjarr?'\nThrough the curtain of wind and snow, a soft calling breaks, and reaches her ears again. Kjarr snaps out of her brief daze, half-woven cloth nestled in her lap. She finds her needle still in one hand, yet the tail of her thread fallen from the other, back into the pile.\n'I'm sorry, Saintess, I believe my mind wandered.'\nThis is her third day learning weaving from the Saintess. The chamber of the Vine-Bead Court they're in is hung with tapestries woven by Enya's own hand. For Enya, pursuing textiles is just another part of her spiritual devotions.\n'Oh... I see. Perhaps I'm teaching a little too fast for you?'\nSat face to face with Kjarr, there is absolutely no blame in Enya's words, her face almost twisted with humble apology.

What's noteworthy is where the fabric originates—\nFollowing Lunacub's eleventh time this quarter attempting to sneak into the warehouse and tripping the security system, Rhodes Island HR had a thorough conversation with her, and found in her possession several unregistered Rhodes Island uniforms (parts of which were shorn off and sewn into her tent). Lunacub's manners were impeccable during the conversation, expressing that she was 'just passing by,' and that 'on the outside, you can take stuff if nobody's watching it.' HR rectified the lapse in Lunacub's understanding, reiterated Rhodes Island discipline, as well as inquired as to where certain other parts of the tent fabric had come from.\n'The grey cloth?

She just knows it's an honor, it's what her parents and herself want to do, so she has to do it.\n\nA Kazemaru no longer cleaning the mud from her head again seeks out the young lord.\nShe has become the lord's shinobi. Her hair is bound beneath her hat, her nails orderly trimmed, and missions arrive secretly one after another from the bamboo tubes into her hands.

The old lord has passed, and Kazemaru has a new outfit.\nThe meeting room isn't secret, but it's cramped and inaccessible; contracts fly back and forth in the open, but it's all too smooth and steady. As the days wear on, Kazemaru flexes her stiffened spine at her office desk, joints chafing with a 'krrk,' and the last time she heard that noise, it was like a hidden weapon scraped at her bones.\nShe doesn't like sitting, nor becoming one of the 'people in black' which that mother had tried to spook her child with.\nThis isn't what she's meant to do. This isn't what she likes to do. She wants to do actual good work. She doesn't want to neglect her skills like this. She wants a new way out, but she still hasn't found the full resolve to take the step.\n\nThe young lord reaches out, brushes away the grime caking Kazemaru's pale hair, and hands her a contract termination, along with a business card for Rhodes Island.\nOne time when returning from work, an unsteady flowerpot was blown into the air, crumbs of soil and leaf fragments flying out to form a graceful arc, and the planter compacted with soil plummeted down and crashed straight onto Kazemaru's head.\nHead covered in soil and ceramic chips, Kazemaru was struck awake—she needed to leave.

I can reclaim half an acre of land a day, but there are so many mouths to feed in the village. If I want to free up the entire mountain to grow food for 'em all, even another century might not be enough!\n'Doctor, got any recipes that'd give me the long life and boundless strength of a burdenbeast?

'I'll see what I can do.'\n\nThe doctor traveled far and wide, and by the time she knocked on the doors of that small courtyard once more, several more tombstones were dotting the wilderness.\nThe farmer was sitting at the doorstep, holding a shriveled ear of wheat. His face had become wrinkled, his fist beating at his chest as he gasped for breath. 'The old burdenbeast passed on. The poor fella didn't even last as long as me.'\nThe doctor had seen this before. She said that he wasn't sick, only that he should avoid excessive exertion, before writing a few more prescriptions.\nThe farmer set the herbs aside: 'I wanna send my youngest to a nomadic city, where he'd have a better future. But, there ain't enough money here, not enough land.'\nHe grasped the reins of the newly-purchased young burdenbeast, and thought long and hard.

Behind them stood <i>their</i> sons and daughters, looking at her as if imploring her to do something.\nThe doctor approached.

The seeds had only been half-sown, and the farmer's youngest son was still there, his legs covered in mud. The old farmer let out a sigh and closed his eyes, and the son began to cry softly.\n\nThe doctor stepped into the mountainous woods.\n'Is there no cure for old age?' Nobody answered, only the whispers of the mountains and trees, and the low cries of the fowlbeasts.\nThe wild mountain lotus spoke: 'There is no cure for old age. The search for immortality is but the pipe dream of nobles and aristocrats.'\n'Is there no cure for illness?'\nThe beastling spoke: 'Illness can be cured.

It was a prototype developed by Raythean Industries, an exoskeleton weighing a hefty 95 kilograms. She had to employ Originium Arts to make it float; otherwise, she had no hope of donning it.\nThe exoskeleton carried an Arts amplification device and possessed some offensive capabilities in close combat.

She didn't care whether Rhodes Island could steal the Maylander technology contained in the staff, but within this tiny box lay centuries of K'uk'ulkan history.\n'Wings,' 'skin,' 'solitude'—these were their burdens, but also their pride.

It is, with no room for doubt, a superlatively written essay. But conferring on her the law school's honor of Outstanding Graduate was a decision I had to vie with some other teachers over.\nHaving taught for decades, we often see students with aspiration in their hearts, their hands faintly trembling against the cover of the Code they swear their oath on, their anticipation and resolution a burning light in their eyes. We also often see students who change course or lose their bearings midway; they ask why a prompt as absurd as 'A thief lacerates a victim's arm intending to intimidate; however, the victim suffers from aplastic anemia and soon passes away from blood loss. What criminal charges and sentencing would be appropriate?' would appear on the bar exam, and soon after are taken aback to find that in Kazimierz, what one learns, what is tested, and what one uses all stand completely on their own. Every clause in the code is well-defined yet unfortunately narrow, and cannot keep pace with the speed at which the arena and the commercial streets develop. The dispute between 'the means justify the ends' and 'the ends justify the means' exists only in the classroom, and in reality, practical law is much more dependent on interpretation, supplementation, and guidance by precedent-setting cases... its form in a vacuum being the true face of Kazimierz law. It's not an easy pill to swallow for us old-timers, to say nothing of the youth.\nDeszcz is a reasonably excellent student. I once advised her to remain at the school to further her studies; perhaps the additional knowledge and dialectical thought would polish her acute mind to possess greater wisdom. However, she was all but itching to unleash her ferocity in true combat. She'd already obtained a formal job offer from the Longrein Law Firm prior to writing this thesis. Before she went into the field, I went and greeted the fine lawyer who took her on, begging him to take care of this student did not yet understand a thing. But he said Deszcz had 'adapted' very well to the firm, had suggested a number of improvements that hit the nail on the head, and spurred headway on their lawsuits, so he exhorted me not to worry too much.\nDeszcz is too clever, and too uncompromising—this is the greatest thing separating her from most students. Her dedication to using law to seek the truth has supported her in achieving such excellent grades, but she has yet to prepare herself for 'being unable to find an answer.' As we all know, the more devout the believer, the more susceptible they are to falling into an even deeper emptiness when that belief crumbles. As teachers, we have no right to choose our students' paths forward. We can only be there behind them, to send them off and wish them well.\nIt's my hope that she doesn't become simply the next youth to lose their way amidst the Grand Knight Territory's resplendent neons.\n......\n\n—Extracted from a speech made by Deszcz's mentor, Professor Łobacz, at the internal evaluation conference for the school's Outstanding Graduates","name":"Deszcz's Graduate Memento","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30024","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30104","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_4036_forcer":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Enforcer","profession":"Specialist","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30031","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30103","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31033","count":3},{"id":"31043","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3281","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3283","count":3},{"id":"31014","count":8},{"id":"31053","count":12}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_forcer_1","icon":"skchr_forcer_1","name":"Deterring Shot","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31034","count":3},{"id":"31013","count":1}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"31054","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_forcer_2","icon":"skchr_forcer_2","name":"Staggering Shot","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31054","count":3},{"id":"30063","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"30054","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"31024","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_forcer","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"PUS","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_forcer","description":"'You want to work at my patisserie?

Still, Laterano's Sankta are famed for doing as they please, and he has no reason to refuse, so the patisserie is where he lets Ezell be.\nAt first, Ezell's work is rough around the edges, clearly too stiff in copying what he sees. He unfailingly takes down all the necessary ingredients, amounts, ratios, and methods in his notebook.\nSome, of course, are floored to recognize what Ezell is. There's even speculation that some major case is developing—why else would a Notarial Hall executor go into hiding here, like this? Still, the week ends without anything of note. And just like at the Notarial Hall, Ezell is never late. But no matter how busy the shop is, he never works overtime, always punctual to clock out.\n'Cecelia, I'm home. Here, cookies.'\n'Thanks, Mister Ezell!'\n'They're really good! Mister Ezell, did you make them?'\n'Mm-hm. In a few more days, once I've made the preparations, we'll head out to see your papà.'\n'Okay!'\n......\n'What?

Notes on his work, timetables, coffee brewing instructions, etc.\nBut on one page, in immature handwriting, is 'I want to eat Lateran sweets,' contrasted by a dessert recipe below in Ezell's script.\n'They'd be hard to find in any stores after leaving Laterano, and would spoil on the way if prepared in bulk beforehand, so the best plan was to learn to make them myself.'\n'I know how implausible leaving Laterano to find a Sarkaz is, given the current circumstances. I have enough faith to stay by Cecelia's side the whole way, but I know that for her, the journey to come will reveal itself to be an ordeal like nothing else.'\n'So I've told her that whenever she wants to do something, she can write in this book. No matter how unrealistic, I'll earnestly plan it out, execute it, and achieve it. So that on this journey, Cecelia's heart remains ever filled with hope.'\nThus explains Ezell.\n'Ah!

A shell had punched a hole through its trunk. The breeze passed through the decaying wood, giving off a mournful sound like some sort of crude instrument.\nAt least it was quieter than the battlefield. Horn was about to rest for a while, but found herself approached as soon as she closed her eyes. 'Here ye are, Captain!' Bagpipe leaned on the officer, her chin resting on her shoulder. Finding it too heavy, Horn tried to pull away, but Bagpipe's Vouivre strength was too great. 'Took me ages to find you,' Bagpipe batted her eyelashes, her tone pitiable, 'Ages and ages.'\nMaybe she was just too tired, she fell sleep. Horn felt guilty about it. As leader of Tempest Platoon, she shouldn't have left her people to go off for a nap. How was the battle going? Had Triangle's recon team returned? Was Bagpipe's injury bothering her? A pile of questions clogged her throat. Footsteps and laughter sounded from behind. Oboe was probably telling bad jokes again, Cello laughed a little later than the others but always the loudest, slapping Oboe's shoulder until he begged for mercy. Bagpipe finally let go of Horn's arm, hopped up, and waved vivaciously to her platoonmates.\nHorn wanted desperately to turn around, but she couldn't. She knew deep down that behind her was nothing but a hole. She couldn't turn around. If she did, those voices would vanish.\n'What sort of dream were you having?' Rosalie's voice dripped with her usual teasing tone, 'Wouldn't hurt to let me take first place once in a while, would it? You're so tired you're out as soon as you hang your head. How unlike you.'\nHorn saw the closed book beside her, with a thin green pen stuck inside. Rosalie had recently taken up felting on the grounds that it relieved the stress of finals. She insisted the tan ball in her hand was Horn's head. Horn repeatedly countered that her hair was a platinum blonde, but Rosalie didn't listen.\n'What did you dream about? The war again?' Rosalie put down her unfinished felt, tapping her chin curiously, 'What does the future look like in your dreams? I'm still thinking about what I might do after graduation. Logistics seems a bit boring. Perhaps I'll be a staff officer? Ooh, I wonder what my first fight will be like? I'll have to count these leisurely days while I still can.'\nUnfortunately, time waits for no woman. The half-finished felt lay on the ground, having turned a muddy color. Horn couldn't guess how Rosalie might craft her face, and she'll never get a chance to find out. She couldn't even remember clearly what Rosalie looked like. The friends had always liked to sit in the brightest places, her bright green hair, her smug smile, they all melted in the fiery sunlight.\nA pair of rough hands landed on Horn's face. She recalled how every time she napped under the maple tree in the yard, her grandmother would walk over and fan her, relieving the heat of the sun and shooing away the flies. This was still a dream, certainly, but this time she was lucid, and she had no intention of opening her eyes. She used to bother her grandmother for stories about the army, her great-great grandfather, and the feats of White Wolves past. Then, she dreamed of fighting for Victoria, just like her ancestors. Now that the war had truly begun, her dreams turned to her grandmother fanning her.\nSteady and strong, the rhythm was more comforting than sleep itself. Horn opened her eyes, and Feist gave her an apologetic smile. He didn't want to wake her with his work. Her shield needed maintenance too. Horn lowered her head and a gust of wind blew by, tiny buds falling from the trees, covering the mottled shield.\nSo, the cannonfire hadn't totally killed her tree after all.","name":"Exemplars","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30135","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30145","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_horn","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"FOR","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_horn","description":"When Horn arrives at that modest Highbury pub, it's already packed. Over a dozen people's heads, Bagpipe waves vigorously to her, jostling half her pint out of the glass before she even makes it all the way over. Once she does, Bagpipe pushes it into Horn's hands, turns, orders a new one, and pours that one straight down the hatch. Her face is ruddy red and altogether sweaty. She's been helping out no small amount here, Horn can tell.\n'Y'know Robben? This is his relative, proper handy, you can just smell the fresh grain off the tipple he brews. Makes you feel all warm inside,' Bagpipe says glowingly. 'C'mon, Leader, try some.'\nHorn stares down at the mellow golden liquid. Just as warm as every other color in this bar. Londinium's past the worst of scarcity, but the workers still use curtains and tablecloths from their own homes to decorate this place out of sheer habit. The pub reopening means a lot to the neighborhood. Real proof that they have their livelihoods back, and a place to drop by after clock-out too.\nOnce the music starts up, Bagpipe tugs a dumbstruck Horn to come along. Bagpipe's kilt is long and flowing and gorgeous as she spins, aglow like a daffodil, like the paraffin lamp by your bedside. It makes Horn conscious of how she's not in uniform either. Her white pencil skirt was rummaged out of her old wardrobe from her academy days. Still fits, but she feels so strange in it. Like two empty hands missing their sword and shield.\n'Leader, move your body a bit! No one's goin' tae laugh at ye.' Bagpipe thinks she's embarrassed. 'Look, just follow ma rhythm now, it isnae hard at all!'\n<i>What rhythm?</i> Horn can't help but crack up at that. If skipping to the beat were a class, Fiona Young'd be losing every last mark.\nReturning to the counter, Horn once again picks up the pintglass Bagpipe got her, and in one fell swoop, downs it.\n'Tastes wonderful,' she grins. 'To Robben.'\n'To Robben,' Bagpipe echoes.\n'And to Abigail, and to Henderson, and to Gwen...' Horn sets the empty glass down. 'Gwen. Hah. What was it, that ale? The one Cello loved more than anything in the whole wide land?'\nBy the time they leave the bar, Horn's walking on much slower legs. With a gust of the evening wind, she makes her way to the curbside, and stoops down low.\n'Leader? Och, go on, chuck it up. You'll feel better for it.'\nHorn shakes her head, but her shoulders are tensing up anyway.\nPicking up on something silent, Bagpipe lifts her hand away before it can land on Horn's back, and opts to places it on her shoulder instead.\nHorn finally raises her head again. Quite unlike Bagpipe would've imagined, her mouth curls up, and her eyes are aglitter.\n'Bagpipe, they came out with my test results. My wounds are more or less recovered, and I didn't get Oripathy.'\nBagpipe grins back. She lifts Horn up, and the two amble together down the still and quiet street.\n'We're so lucky, you and I,' Bagpipe says.\n'Yeah.' Drawing a deep breath, Horn looks out at the faraway city walls, and the warm lights above it that faintly swim into view.

Here's a present from me to you! I was gonna whip you up a manual, but Stainless provided the parts, and his two cents are to forget about introducing this drone in writing, so I recorded you a video instead! First, you gotta open...'\nRockrock comes to Rhodes Island's training grounds and, following Closure's guidance, pilots this sudden and impromptu gift. The drone nimbly sweeps through simulated battlefront, casting its tiny shadow on the floor.\nExcellent acceleration, excellent turn speed, excellent climb and descent speed, minimal handling delay, stable hovering. It's a fine enough combat drone already. But Rockrock has a hunch that it could be made even better. Call it a keen eye when it comes to manufactured products; call it the high standards of an excellent technician.\nHeading back to her dorm, she disassembles her present. In the process, she gasps with marvel more than once at its design. Only the best of the best craftwork could have created its structural chassis, with a state-of-the-art console clearly responsible for the precision cutting. Its control system's cable management looks 100% orderly, every last hair of savable space saved. The design itself was likely engineered with her piloting habits in mind. Still, the issue might lie exactly here—in the greedy pursuit of lightweight structural configuration, its cutting-edge energy sources can't output its full potential... Rockrock doesn't understand. Why would Closure design it this way?\nAfter carefully inspecting all over, she's astonished to find a tiny little box crammed into the drone's chassis, with all the parts and wiring routing around it. It's as if the designer expressly scooped out a region from an already lightweight skeleton... Opening the box to take a look, she finds a note scrawled with little pictures of both Closure and her—'To Rockrock from Closure!'\nLooking at the note, a wordless feeling wells up within her. It's the implicit trust that exists only between artisans—I just knew you'd find the real gift.

Coming to observe the geysers, Chestnut was greeted with an unexpected subterranean eruption followed by a mine collapse. Amid the chaos, he pushed through the fleeing masses, brandishing his medical license as he advanced against the current. After a long night of aid, he declined the grimy coins offered by the grateful miners, accepting instead a pristine piece of pyrite.\nA fossilized tree root from Sami. Traveling aimlessly to the far north, Chestnut clutched the fossil and sought a local diviner. They interpreted the ancient tree root, hidden for millennia, to say: 'The expansive land surpasses your wildest dreams. Never cease your journey.'\nAn uncut jade from Yan. At a bustling food stall, Chestnut used money pawned from the jade to treat two feuding groups of youths to local delicacies. Post-meal, the young men reconciled, chipped in for the jade back.

Whenever he did, he did so for the whole day. Jordi had carefully chosen his position, and watching from this angle at sunset, the sinking sun in the west would line up with the tip of the lighthouse for the briefest moment, like this tiny little lighthouse too had come alight.\nRegrettably, it was a fleeting scene, and in the span of a few short breaths, the lighthouse statue would once again go out. Everything about it would be rapidly shrouded in shadow, engulfed by darkness. What he had just witnessed was much like an illusion, gone without a trace.\nFortunately, the sun would rise as it did before the next day, and the lighthouse would come alight again. Just for a moment, of course.\nOn the day of his ninth birthday, Jordi decided to do something big. He wanted to grab hold of something more lasting. He'd try and see for himself what the town's elder workers were so proud of yet kept so secret, see for himself the colossal structure the parents he'd never met had disappeared in, see for himself that true 'Eye of Iberia.' Jordi began to climb the statue in the plaza, believing as long as he stood on its top, he'd be able to see the true rays of the lighthouse piercing through the fog. He clambered inch by inch, hearing the passersby in the plaza shrieking frantically, but the top was right there before him, he just had to make one final leap...\nJordi suddenly felt himself falling—the protrusion he'd used as footing likely crumbled—but why he was falling was no longer important. Jordi had struggled so he could cast his sight far away. Even if it was only for a split-second, he wanted to see it.\nNothing. There was nothing. The fog was like a gauze, covering all upon the surface of the sea.\nWhen Jordi came to, he was already back at home, his leg bandaged, the scent of meat porridge pervading the room. Hearing the sound of Jordi turning over, Thiago poked his body out of the kitchen. Jordi thought he'd be in for a ferocious scolding, but Thiago simply stared at him for a moment, let out a sigh, and pointed in the direction of the desk. There was laid a spyglass, glittering in alluring bronze.\nThat was a bygone affair, years and years ago, and now the scar has even faded. Only the small town's plaza seems to have been overlooked by time, resting unchanged. Jordi sits in his younger self's most favorite spot. Now he's seen the true Eye of Iberia, yet he can no longer sit on this bench with his uncle, listening to those heart-racing stories, taking turns at the spyglass through which they'd gaze far away.\nBut even with the help of a spyglass, they still couldn't see anything.

Has an Ægir set foot in the Inquisition's court in any capacity other than that of the tried. The very words themselves are preposterous.\nIt was a young man, not particularly remarkable at first glance. Of fair height, but didn't stand too straight or firm. His features were proper, but lacked any good presence. In all regards, not someone especially worth minding. If it weren't for the fact he was an Ægir, I think even someone new like myself wouldn't have batted an eye at him, with how unassuming and overt his arrival was.\nBut now, all the Inquisition is abound with the rumor of this Ægir.\nSome say he's some wicked convict's bosom friend, merely held temporarily in custody, but this young man—before I forget, his name is Jordi Fontanarossa—clearly has no restrictions placed on his movements. Others believe he's a signal from Lord Carmen that the Inquisition is once again to admit and even promote some of the Islanders in due time. However, Jordi Fontanarossa himself is feeble and weak, and his education lacking. At best, he would be capable of some meager secretarial work, and it doesn't seem as if his position is particularly lofty.\nGiven our workplaces are so near each other, I've had the opportunity to observe him.\nThis Ægir punches in at twenty minutes before his shift each morning, sometimes a little later, but he's never tardy. He's prone to occasional clumsiness; he once caused a misprint of documents after poorly operating the press, wasting quires of business paper. If I hadn't chanced to pass by and stop the machine, who knows how his accident could have evolved.\nI wasn't going out of my way to help him, of course, simply taking responsibility for our work. And no matter how I explained to him as such, the Ægir just persisted with his smile. He'd clearly misunderstood something! Such a loathsome smile!\nOne time, in relation to a vital operation, some colleagues and I were working overtime into the night. The Ægir brought a bucket of drinks over, telling us it was some herbal tea he'd mixed himself. I wasn't interested in having any, but that sort of thing <i>is</> effective at keeping one awake, so for the sake of work, it would have to do.\nIt was about early morning by the time we were done with overtime, and everyone was audibly starving, running on bellies filled with nothing but tea. There in the dark, I suddenly heard footsteps approach, then saw someone had lit a lantern. It was that Ægir, who himself hadn't left for some reason, and had a pot in his hands too, with several bags clearly filled with food hanging from his wrists.\n'Ah, are you all done with work? You must be exhausted.'\nThe man seemed all too apologetic as he regarded us. 'I'm sorry I couldn't be of help with any of it. All I could do was make some food that'd be light on the stomach...'\nWith no patience for hearing out his habitual self-debasement and humbling excuses, I took his pot without any fanfare.\nIt was a vanilla porridge, and all signs pointed to it being yet another recipe beneficial to health.\nLord Carmen having taken in this Ægir as a disciple? Absolutely never would I lend credence to such a ridiculous rumor. That said, based on what I've seen, should the Inquisition decide it <i>would</i> readmit Islanders, I suppose it would hardly be a bad thing.","name":"'Luck'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30145","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30135","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_4043_erato":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Erato","profession":"Sniper","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30011","count":10}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30013","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31013","count":3},{"id":"30043","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3241","count":4},{"id":"30052","count":4},{"id":"30062","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3243","count":3},{"id":"30064","count":5},{"id":"30103","count":11}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_erato_1","icon":"skchr_erato_1","name":"Lullaby's Meter","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30064","count":2},{"id":"30043","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30014","count":2},{"id":"30094","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30084","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_erato_2","icon":"skchr_erato_2","name":"Heroes' Paean","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"30053","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31014","count":3},{"id":"30014","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":5}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_erato","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"SIE","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_erato","description":"Erato has been in the forest south of the village for a whole month.\nShe sits on a tree branch, idly plucking her bowstring.

Who's wearing red?'\nHeidi clears her throat and stands, then immediately realizes it might be a bad idea and tries to sit back down, but the Sarkaz marches over to her before she can.\n'Let's go for a walk.'\nHeidi stares helplessly at the Count, whose mask shows not a crack. Well. She turns to the Sarkaz.\n'Sir, you mustn't treat me so.'\n'The hell do you think you are?'\n'I'm a novelist,' Heidi huffs with attempted bluster, though her shudders give her away. 'I was just picking up a letter from a reader!'\nThe Sarkaz, paying no attention to her excuse, is busy rifling through every possible hiding place on her—and sure enough finds a letter, its words of gushing praise run by rainblots.\n'Well, you've been more cooperative than some.

'You're not going anywhere much worse than this place, anyway.'\n'Really?'\nThat takes him aback for a moment, and then he laughs.\n'How does someone stupid as you come up with any stories worth writing down?

What dignity does one piffling hat even have today, in the rains of Londinium?'\nIt's with some shock that the Count properly regards the rain-soaked novelist, who he thought would be in hysterics over the disgrace he had allowed her to suffer.\n'I'm no fool, and you're no coward.

Its appearance was exactly as I'd requested: a simple metal case with not a hint of adornment, a wand with the surface polished to a mirror sheen, and a spherical energy reserve unit in a full silver color. Freshly produced, the Originium circuitry gave off the smell of solvent.\nI picked up the wand from the case, and the reserve smoothly floated up with it, responding to the wand's movements, resting into a stable orbit in the air some thirty or forty centimeters from my hand.\nI fired the reserve out, and the red circle bullseye at the center of the alloy was dented inwards by it. Impeccable energy conversion efficiency.\nThe Engineering operator's and my expressions were in total accord. We understood what a masterpiece this was.\n\nSome months later, I met him again, bringing my old wand with me, and some Originium dice in my pocket.\n'Old shoes do fit easier,' he remarked.\nI could only shrug.\n'Still, I'd like to know why you went back to your old equipment,' he said, his gaze sharp behind his goggles. 'Even if it's just cosmetic reasons—no skin off my nose. Call it a little after-sales service courtesy of Engineering.'\n'Because of... the noise.'\n'Noise?'\nI simply pulled out my wand and give it a perfunctory wave. The tip streaked through the air, but what came was not the sound of slicing air, but music.\n'I did some research into your wand there, when we got your request. The frequencies it vibrates against the air at are beyond common sense, I can tell you that. It's a real mystery, but it doesn't do anything to help casting. Doesn't hinder either, though.'\n'I understand, but this ties to my—'\nMy personal affairs.\nI ordered the wand precisely to distance myself from that bothersome music. It and the fantastical melody that once played at the Afterglow Hall are all but the same. For each day that I use the wand, that night I dream of that scene again, and hear that melody.\nThe new wand successfully quietened my dreams, but the scene still laid before me, the silent struggle all the more wretched, the silent death throes all the more terrible.\nOnly once I took up my old wand again did I understand. That nightmare would run its way through my entire life—had already done so—and to try and forget was mere futility.\nI couldn't flee it, and couldn't reconcile with it either. I was forced to concede that it was a part of me, and that I would fight it for the rest of my days.\nAs now well demonstrated. I was the one who ordered the wand, and the one who gave up on it.\nGraf Urtica simply walked away from it all, and left all the trouble and anger to others, but Ebenholz could not.\nOf course, Ebenholz could denounce those morons who thought themselves so lofty; however, faced with a craftsman who he'd offended, did he truly have the right to send them packing with but a few vile words?\nIf it were... him, what would he do? What would he want me to do?\nThe answer couldn't be any clearer.\nWith difficulty, I cleared my throat, unsure if I would offend the craftsman once again with this.\n'The story is a little long, but... if you're willing to listen, I can explain in full detail.'","name":"'Theory Expositor'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30135","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_004_ebnhlz","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"MSC","type":"D","icon":"uniequip_004_ebnhlz","description":"'Are you that attached to this place?'\nSunlight streams in through the window, glass filtering it clean of its warmth, turning it as frigid and dirty as the panes.\n'This parlor is just as I remember it—not very big. The only difference is, the mold is ever ranker now, isn't it?\nEbenholz paces through the deserted parlor. The expensive furnishings that once filled it have now either been stolen to sell by retainers fleeing the spire, or simply left behind due to their sheer value. He spies that someone tried to move the excessively large piano, but gave up for whatever reason, their attempt having left a visible scratch on the floorboards. Comical, and loathsome. The walls are thick with dust and mildew, no longer showing any sign of the patterns beneath. The only familiar sight is the fireplace sunk into the wall. The timbers' ashes lie under a fresher layer of grime, but they're still there in the hearth, just as Ebenholz had left them.\n'It's been a long while since you left, and no one's lit the fireplace in the meantime, hence the dust and rot. That's been the story of this room, yes, ever since you left.'\nEbenholz approaches the fireplace. He can still almost remember how it used to burn. There was a fire here. There was warmth. Now, though, it is an ugly yawning chasm, and all he finds in its maw is darkness. Ebenholz lifts a hand to brush away the stale air, and refreshes himself if only for a moment.\n'Will that even help? Five seconds, ten, and the foul air will fill your nostrils once more.'\nEbenholz draws his wand. The Originium dice float, circling in a steady orbit, letting off light and heat.\n'Of course you could do that. Raise a gust of wind, summon a ball of fire, those are simple feats for you. They can blow away the dust, burn off the rot. You've tried as such before. You've seen some results.'\nSilent, Ebenholz puts away his wand, and the Originium dice fall back into his hand. He bends over, the darkness inside the fireplace staring out at him.\n'But they always come back, don't they? You can resist, you can refuse, you can do everything you can to keep the darkness at bay. You've contended with it all for far too long. You can choose to brush away the miasma, you can choose to leave Urtica, you can choose to hide, and the further the better. Light your glimmering lights until you lose count, but you will never keep the long night from becoming day.'\nEbenholz reaches into the ashes, and pulls out a wizened branch, not wholly consumed.\n'Decay will keep creeping over this parlor with endless arms, until it clambers into your mind and body, just as it ate at your parents, and all the masters of this spire before them.'\n'No!' In an instant, the dizziness born from the depths of his brain takes hold of his entire consciousness. Ebenholz's vision blurs. The voice sneers, loudly and clearly.\nFrom the scorched branch protrudes a bud, just as black and burnt, and it pierces through Ebenholz's palm, and winds about his wrist, binding his arm. It grows thorns, pricking his skin, stabbing into his marrow. Fresh blood springs forth, trickling down the branch's length, falling into the darkness and mingling with the embers.\n'Urtica's veins are the branches of the dark. The decay and withering are nigh. You cannot break free.'\nEbenholz opens his eyes. The branch is not in his hand; his arm has landed in a layer of fine ash. No wounds, the blood still flowing beneath his skin. The beating of his pulse seems to suggest all that happened just now was an illusion. An illusion—I want no more illusions.\n'No.' Ebenholz finally breaks his silence. 'I know decay and withering will take Urtica's every branch and leaf. I know that so long as your soul still lingers throughout my body, this nightmare will never end.\n'But this rot, this shambling corpse of trite rhetoric, has lingered for too long now.'\nEbenholz stares back into the dark within the fireplace. The charred branch lies upon the embers there, stained with fresh blood, permeating the black soil. Its blood seeps into the cracks, with first heat, then a spark, and then flashes are crackling about the branch's tip. In an instant, they gather together into a black flame, engulfing the entire branch. Once more, the embers begin to burn.\n'So it will conclude. So it will end, full stop.'\nThe fireplace is lit with a flame blacker than the dark itself, the glow from the charred branch filling the whole parlor. The voice finally ceases to jeer, ceases to respond.\n'How about I go meet that so-called Austere Authority for myself.'","name":"Lineage of Decay","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30145","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_4047_pianst":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Czerny","profession":"Defender","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30031","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"31023","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30043","count":2},{"id":"30093","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3231","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3233","count":3},{"id":"30084","count":8},{"id":"31033","count":11}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_pianst_1","icon":"skchr_pianst_1","name":"Fingerfertigkeit","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":3},{"id":"31044","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"31054","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_pianst_2","icon":"skchr_pianst_2","name":"Meisterwerk","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31034","count":3},{"id":"31013","count":1}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"31034","count":3}]]}],"modules":[]},"char_4048_doroth":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Dorothy","profession":"Specialist","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30011","count":6},{"id":"30061","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30032","count":4},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30083","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30093","count":4},{"id":"30013","count":5}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3281","count":5},{"id":"30062","count":5},{"id":"30012","count":7}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3283","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"31054","count":8}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_doroth_1","icon":"skchr_doroth_1","name":"Dangerous Entity Removal","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30093","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"30084","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"31054","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_doroth_2","icon":"skchr_doroth_2","name":"Quicksand Generation","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31014","count":4},{"id":"30013","count":11}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31034","count":4},{"id":"30104","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_doroth_3","icon":"skchr_doroth_3","name":"High-speed Resonating Troubleshooter","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31024","count":4},{"id":"30103","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31054","count":4},{"id":"30064","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"31014","count":6}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_doroth","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"TRP","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_doroth","description":"An ear-bleeding klaxon pierces the night, a girl shaken from her dream.\nSand flies about the base's entire perimeter, the storm beating violently against every door and window.

She also attempted to call her father, whose whereabouts were unknown, but never received a response, only the murmur of pale despair. It was like holding a candle in the dark, unable to see the way forward or find the way back, but still persistently believing in the false, icy hope she gripped.\nAccording to Operator Absinthe's recollection, she thought she heard her father's voice from her communication device just as she was about to fall unconscious. She sprung up in surprise and luckily avoided Reunion forces passing by. However, the message was too short for her to even confirm whether it was a real voice or a hallucination brought on by fear, hunger, and despair.\n\nAfter coming to Rhodes Island, Operator Absinthe persists in attempting to contact her father through the communication device when there is no one around, as if he is silently listening to the other end.\n'Dad, are you there? They took me to a place called Rhodes Island. They say it's safe here... I hope it's true.'\n'Dinner was tough today, but I still ate a lot.'\n'I started training at Rhodes Island, with Instructor Dobermann... Err, she's my teacher. She says I'm doing well, but...

I think I'm getting taller, Dad.'\n'Dad, are you listening...?'\n...\n\n'Regarding the phenomenon of hearing her father's voice from the communication device, Operator Absinthe comes close to bringing it up to the medical operators during her psychological treatments. With different memory fragments overlapping and pieced together, and according to information collected later in Chernobog, our assessment is that this communication may have really occurred, but it very likely did not come from Absinthe's father's comm. Rather, it was a Reunion transmission. When the mob located and assaulted the location where the remaining civilian police officers had taken refuge, Absinthe's father's voice was picked up in the ensuing chaos.'\n'As for why an Ursus police communicator received a Reunion signal, the most likely explanation is channel interference, calling for no further inquiry.'\n'The above medical record will be expunged

He'd rather jump off the ship than turn in this design for a New Zeruertzan landmark as it is!\nHe averts his eyes from it as fast as he can. Like it or not, he made that model himself, and it burns him—it leers at him. <i>What now, proud architect?</i> Tasking him with 'fun' was an exercise in self-defeat.\n'I can't do it.'\nCan't he defend his dignity in any way? He dithers in circles, growing all the more agitated. No, now he feels like he's being lassoed along. He once chased after his departed 'design representative' with all the same agitation, and the harder he held on, the harder that title threatened to tear him in two. Like his right leg, the responsibility stung relentlessly: a reminder of how short his life was, how every standstill was a step forever lost.\nHe can't stop now.\nHe roots around everywhere he can, dying for some flash of inspiration to save him. Sketches fly into the air, models tumble to the ground, and still... still no eureka moment. He claws at his head in annoyance, and then, he comes face to face with the very last thing in the room.\nA barrel of berry tomato wine.\nFrom Catch. His fellow Durin are all big drinkers—where they're concerned, booze and fun more or less go hand in hand. Still, he recalls his mentor languidly staring out the window at the dome from time to time, sitting with a glass at the table.\nHe resists the idea, but the thought of trying is hard to stifle once it surfaces. He strains to pry the barrel open, then fills a glass. The scent of it actually stuns him for a moment. His reflection in it ripples with memory.\n'If you're curious, you may as well try.'\nHe did as his mentor said, accepting the bottle proffered and pouring the entire thing. The fierce bite of it made him dizzy, threatening to write off the rest of his workday. He scratched at the tiny rocks on his right leg as hard as he could, just hoping the pain would keep him sober still.\nBut his mentor laughed at that.\n'Enjoying life is our finest trait, and what we founded our homeland on. You're no exception, Stitch. You'll understand one day.'\nHearing that voice from long ago wakes him back up. He's startled to find himself reclining carefree in his chair, glass in hand just like Catch and his mentor and all the other Durin, quietly gazing out the cabin window. He subconsciously moves to scratch at his leg's stones, but his hand freezes.\nHe has no throbbing pain beneath the stones. He didn't feel it when he eyed the wine barrel. He hasn't felt it for a long, long time now.\n'Gavial, finally! He's been hiding in his studio forever!'\n'Alright, alley-oop—'\nThe door bursts open, and Gavial's fist stops just a finger's width from his nose.\n'Gavial? Perfect timing. Take me to the Medical Department—it's time for my treatment. What are you all staring at?'\nGavial gawks at the model rec facilities on the table behind him, a simple and surefire crowd-pleaser.

took a disembodied hand flying past her head for Lavinia to snap out of it.\nJust a few hours ago, she'd concluded her first ever trial of Famiglia matters.\nEver since she decided to walk this path, she'd heard of—and experienced—many a Famiglia's interference with the justices. Some around her had even gone missing by now.\nBut she stayed her course. After all, she'd long prepared herself mentally. These troubles could not trounce her; in fact, the more they cropped up, the more she believed she had to change this status quo.\n—All until she finished her work for the day, and entered the alley where she had parked her vehicle.\nIt was then that she thought she should drop in tomorrow to see the man who'd supported her taking this path, to tell him how she hadn't let him down. And on the other hand she thought, perhaps, that that would make her seem too much a pushover; maybe something sterner was called for. After all, should his own Famiglia fall afoul of a lawsuit themselves, she could only be impartial.\nIf not for that familiar hand pulling her down, her head may well have been skewered by the bolt.\nShe felt her own thoughts halt, leaving her staring blankly at the hand's owner—Bernardo stood in her way, taking out each figure that rushed her one by one.\nAnd only once she snapped out of it did she finally realize the gulf between what she'd heard and pictured, and experiencing it personally.\nA momentary silence descended on the alley, at which point Bernardo gave the underlings to his rear a nod, and they brought out a box half her size.\nBernardo opened it, and within, there laid a metal gauntlet with a hammer shackled to it. Under the dusk streetlamps, their gold luster almost stung the eye, but what hurt most about them to see was the circle of thorns winding about the glove.\n'I'm not going to protect you forever, Lavinia,' said Bernardo, as he took out the gauntlet and handed it to her. 'If you want to survive on this path, then you've got to learn to protect yourself, starting today.'\nShe was silent for a spell, took the gauntlet, and with no regard for the pain its sharp thorns laced across her skin, she put it on. Then, she walked deeper into the alley depths.\nShe and Bernardo had brushed with death. She knew though the night was deep as ever, Bernardo would not take the same path as her. She had to go it alone into the darkness, a black dyed in sanguine red.\nThe first and only gift Bernardo would ever give her was stained by blood on its very first day.","name":"The Thorny Road That Continues","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30135","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30115","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_judge","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"UNY","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_judge","description":"Night is always hard, especially the ones where she tosses and turns on the bed, waiting for the night to pass. The pale, faded light of dawn is the guest that has yet to arrive, for whom there is nothing to do but wait.\nSuch nights are a familiar friend to Lavinia. What awaits after an exhausting day is yet another exhausting day, filled with pretentious defending counsels, arrogant famiglia and silent judges. The sound of the gavel echoes through the court, yet it is no different from a fairground game, except worse, because at least in a fairground the hammer whacks the mole.\nWhen tormented by such cruel nights, Lavinia pulls out the creased letter from the bottom of her drawer. She remembers finding it under her windscreen wipers; such letters were usually threats and warnings, but this was an exception.\nIt is a short letter, scribbled down hastily, reproaching Lavinia for pronouncing innocent a defendant that the famiglia had sent into the courthouse to take the fall. The letter wrote that Lavinia's 'self-righteous' judgment had done more harm than good, a complaint that she had seen many times: The small attempts of the judges to do the right thing are often futile, any small justice achieved in the courthouse quickly swallowed by the dark night outside.\nYet the writer, after what seemed to be a long struggle with himself, left this line at the end: 'No one cares, but at least there was one person who said I was innocent. Thanks.'\nLavinia has tried to deduce whom the writer of this unusual letter was, which is akin to trying to find a needle in a haystack. There have been so many, people whom she knew were innocent, whom she pronounced innocent, but what of it? As the writer of the letter said: No one cares.\nLavinia never stopped searching. Perhaps she wanted to tell the writer face-to-face, that justice would never be alone and fleeting, as long as she was there, that justice would come at the gavel's drop, as the dawn breaks the night.\nThat is, until she found the coroner's autopsy report on her desk. The cause of death was suicide.\nIf this was the end that Siracusa had for its judges, then what was the point of the justice that she sought?\nA creased letter, a word of thanks. However insignificant it was, even if it could not light her desk like a lamp, perhaps there was someone who felt that she was the only defender of justice, then and there.\nAnd so, she never gave up, even if she fights a lonely battle. If she gives up, there will be no one left to fight it; if she kept silent, there will be no one to speak up.\nThere are two ways to live with the night before the dawn. Allow it to consume oneself, until one does not feel it, or search for what should not be consumed by it, and keep those things safe.\nThe one thing that must not be surrendered is the right to define the light.","name":"'Innocent'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30145","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30115","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_4066_highmo":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Highmore","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30031","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30093","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30103","count":3},{"id":"31023","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":7},{"id":"30042","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":3},{"id":"30014","count":9},{"id":"31043","count":13}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_highmo_1","icon":"skchr_highmo_1","name":"Surrendrance from Hindsight","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"31024","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"31044","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_highmo_2","icon":"skchr_highmo_2","name":"Evanescence from Paranoia","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30104","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":3},{"id":"31044","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"31054","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_highmo","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"REA","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_highmo","description":"This is not the first time I bring you out to sea.

You've learned to converse with them, haven't you? You love to chatter with them, and they are glad to tell you how they are feeling. Do you still remember what they told you? They are but one part of the sea; they are one and the same. You know where the surges will stop and rest, and you know where the tiniest suds will assimilate into the ocean.

Though the children are bound to misbehave, these chatty brats seem cute and well-behaved compared to the troublemakers who came by for their physicals yesterday. Most Infected children have already started to stabilize, with many of them who had lost their mobility gradually recovering.\nAs for the non-Infected children, excessive weight gain has been observed in some of them, which we've assessed to be reasonable, given the fact that many of them suffered from malnutrition while growing up in harsh environments, and proper nutritious intake at Rhodes Island is likely to result in rapid weight gain.\nHowever, Operator Luo Xiaohei's weight gain is somewhat peculiar. First, his diet falls within a reasonable range. His companions, Ah Gen and Xiaobai, have told us that they have never seen him overeat. Second, he gets plenty of exercise: in addition to his regular operations, he also makes a habit of exercising.\nBased on the above two points, we believe that his weight gain requires further observation to rule out any potential pathological factors that may lead to further problems. We recommend scheduling tests starting next week to identify what these factors might be.\n\n[Excerpts from a Medical Department Operator's Private Logs]\nI'm so tired after a long day of work. My neck and back are aching. I just want to go back to the dorm and crash.\nMy goodness, when will I be free from dealing with all these uncooperative patients? And then there's the brats who won't stop running around...\nWhen I first graduated, I was filled with a sense of duty. Now, I just feel dead inside.\nI ran into that black cat again on my way to Medical this morning. It often shows up there, and a lot of my colleagues have seen it. I suppose it enjoys lying there, basking in the sun. Some of the folks who pass by try to play with it, but it basically ignores everyone unless they offer food.

No wonder he'd dubbed the plans 'Dreams' and stuck them in the most eye-catching spot of his workbench.\nThe creativity on show in the blueprints was succinct: Preserve the motor core of an FMC, then upgrade it with an all-terrain ambulatory mechanical installation.\n'How many neat automation ideas has this guy got hidden up in that head of his?' Closure was heard to say in appraisal, which served to stir up Engineering even more. Finally, one voice said what everyone was secretly thinking—\n'Let's get this thing made while he's out in the field!'\nPredictably they came to a resounding agreement. They'd all received Feist's help in ways both big and small, or been given one of his timely little presents. Moreover, not one operator there would ever refuse the chance to make someone's dream a reality.\nSeveral workshops joined hands and got down to work, all of Engineering bustling like nobody's business. Driven by wanting to finish it before Feist got back, sticking points were overcome one after another, and progress flew by far smoother than usual. Very soon, the main chassis was fully built, short of just one final step: merging it with a Feist Metal Crab motor system.\nOnce 'MERGE SUCCESSFUL' flashed up on their giant display, ardent applause filled all of Engineering. A brand spanking new automated transport vehicle could enter operation, and it couldn't have happened without the combined hard work of Feist and every single other engineer. Some operators had already begun to imagine how he would react to seeing it: would a lad who'd pulled himself out of the fires of war shed a tear or two? Or would he laugh like mad and give everyone a giant hug?\nThat was when a question came that threw everyone off, its asker stood over by the generator.\n'How does the FMC motor system... actually work?'\nClearly, nobody had given thought to this one little detail preserved from the design, and a moment of silence ensued that felt like forever.\n'Hey, what're you lot all gathered in here for?'\nFeist, who'd come back aboard earlier, gave the crowd a puzzled stare before his eyes fell on the little sheetmetal fellow they surrounded. He blinked, then blinked again, making sure he wasn't just hallucinating.\n'Hold on, you got the Crawler all built? I don't know what to say!'\nAll of Engineering's eyes were on him as he picked up a steel pipe and gave the 'Crawler' a hefty tap on the back. With a loud rumble, the 'Crawler' slowly whirred into motion. That was the instant that reminded everyone just how the FMC operated.\nA few days later, the children aboard Rhodes got the gift Stainless had promised them: a little people-carrying robot that moved when you struck it. There in the shade of a thicket of steel, both his and their dreams had come true at once.\nNow they just needed to find an open space, and everyone could experience the joy of riding a burdenbeast.","name":"FMC-Crawler","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30145","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30115","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_ironmn","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"CRA","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_ironmn","description":"Rhodes Island has been invited to tour Highbury, which in recent times is all but the beating heart of Victorian industry. So, you, together with a convoy of operators looking forward to some exchange study, step for the first time in a while onto its formerly war-blighted soil.\nAll is not as you left it. No longer is Highbury crossed with heat and the sweat of brows; now, it's a well-oiled machine, the picture of order. With a grin, Stainless tells you that you've the Londinium Industry Development Association to thank—they've brought together every factory, advanced every proposal, combined every assembly line they could to produce the Highbury of today.\nYou don't tell him you heard as much on the factory tour you just took (you've been at this since morning, and it was your hunger that had you leave the rest of the ops to their tour while you nipped out for a bite to eat); it's been a while since you've seen Stainless talk so glowingly, and you're not about to interrupt him. You just nod along while you scan about for that smashing fried fin place he told you of the last time you were in town.\nWhat greets you when you get there, though, is a random factory's side door. Only then in your hunger do Stainless's words register properly: the whole borough's layout got revised, which meant the fin place had to move premises. Your stomach chooses this moment to grumble loudly.\n'What's that, Doctor, getting peckish? I was just going to say, that best chippy in town I told you about a while back? It's right here!'\nYou nod, perplexed as to why Stainless is stopping here... and opening the door to beckon you in. Is he <i>trying</i> to starve you?\nA moment later, a giant stonking thing appears before your eyes with a thunderous boom. Stainless skips over and hops into the cockpit, and shakes you out of your stunned stupor with a yell. 'The Crawler! Doctor, I give you The Crawler!\nDidn't I mention we were revising the borough layout? Well, they wanted to optimize out the food stands, up the place's total usability—but I didn't think so! Factories might define Highbury, but so do our little eateries!'\n'So?' you shout back, swept along by his sudden fervor.\n'So—'\nWith Stainless at the helm, THWOOMP! The Crawler's shell unfolds in all directions to reveal its inner workings—and what should greet you but several stands. One stand's owner in particular is frying her fins with the half an arm the war left her, and she's deft as ever. She greets you all smiles.\n'How's that for a show? A decommissioned first-model Crawler! Couldn't leave it gathering dust on the factory floor, and I so happen to have a stand to run! Now it's the Nomadic Food Crawler! Look, got my hand-drawn sign up there and everything!'\nYou're dumbstruck, and in your dumbstruckedness climb up a Crawler leg and into the thing, and continue to be dumbstruck as Stainless guides you through ordering a whole table's worth of food. Finally, your mouth closes again around a bite of crisp golden battered fin, and you feel happiness permeate all throughout you. It's now that you see Stainless up in the Crawler's cockpit, the wind tousling his hair, and when he looks over his shoulder, your eyes meet.\n'Doctor! This is a lot like that dream I told you about, right? That stupid, barmy dream.'\nYou nod.\nHe throws his arms wide open as he welcomes the wind and sun that rush to greet him.

Recently, everything seems to be smooth sailing for Miss Lin. She's had one success after the other, taking over the redevelopment of several old neighborhoods and earning the praise of our residents. Special mention goes to the amusement park—my sai lou zai's always pestering me to bring him there! Ah, I feel a headache coming on already!\nLin: It was my first time handling such a massive project, so I hope you'll all forgive me for any mistakes I might have made.\nReporter: And so humble! I must say, though, you have a good eye. Before you worked your magic, these 'laan gai' and 'hak gai' were so infamous that even big shots would make detours around our less reputable alleys... Could you share with us some of your experiences on this project?\nLin: 'Less reputable'? If any part of Lungmen is less reputable, then my colleagues and I are at fault. No one hates making money, so I need only bring everyone to one table and hammer down a price we can all be happy with.\nReporter: True enough, but they've been called 'laan gai' since our parents' generation, yet you cut out those decades-old tumors in a matter of months, Miss President. I can only imagine you have some special friends at the table?\nLin: Any connections I have are the ones I've invested in. As for the people I know, isn't it only natural to become friends with your business partners?\nReporter: And here I thought you had some ace up your sleeve—or maybe it's a trade secret you can't disclose?\nLin: Haha. I didn't realize you'd be so into gossip, sir.\nReporter: Everyone knows how gang-infested these streets are. Who knows what trouble might be just around the corner...\nLin: If I had an answer to that, I'd be the Chief of the L.G.D. by now. Though you're pretty promising yourself, to have so much information and be asking such incisive questions.\nReporter: Hahaha, you flatter me. But I must confess one small regret I have—that in just one conversation you've made it that much harder for me to consider a career change!\nLin: You're too humble. To borrow a phrase from Lungmen's fengshui masters: when prosperity blooms, bad things will naturally leave. I'd also like to use this airtime to ask everyone to support my work as the President of the LYEA.\n......\n\n'Mm, this is fine.

It would be impossible to silence voices like his for good.\n'Let me ask you this: If I told you Lungmen has the potential to grow its businesses for both itself and everyone else, and that is what I really want...\n'Would you believe me?'\n'...I would.'\n'*sigh* Does it matter if you do?'\n'Siu ze, I—'\n'They don't need to know what I want.

The clothes she wore did not appear local, resembling the style of Jiangqi more. 'That's thousands of li away; how did she end up here?' He looked around and found she had nothing with her—no money, no food, no water—yet despite so many people passing by, nobody was willing to help her.\nAny other time, and he would've walked away like all the others. But business had been flourishing, and he was in a good mood. Watching the poor girl before him, he couldn't help but think of his own miserable days, when he wished someone would help him... To save someone is an act of great kindness, and today he was more than glad to be a good person and help this girl.\nHe untied the waterskin from his waist, gave her a few sips, and dragged her into the shade of a boulder.

Several corpses lie in the sand, covered by a thin layer of powdery snow.\nRecently, bandits have been quite active outside the village, and the villagers pooled together their money to hire her to take care of them. They said that after a string of Catastrophes, the harvests in the area were disappointing. With poor harvests came poor business. With no money in their purses, bandits began to sprout up like weeds.\nAfter all the whining and complaining, they began to praise Qiubai's skills. The bandits knew they were at the end of their rope, so they took the village's children hostage. Yet she seized the opportunity and struck, slaying them all in a single strike.\nShe does not say a thing.\nShe recognizes the waterskin—or rather, the wine pouch, from which a murky and choking liquor flows—dangling from the waist of a corpse.\nShe thinks back to the man's smile just a few years ago, and to the few sips of water and coins that had kept her going until she could reach the next town. The corpse still holds in his hand a knife—modified from a farming sickle—blackened by layers of blood both new and old. As for her own blade, it had yet to be wiped clean, and still drips red with fresh blood.\nShe sets down her bamboo snow hat in front of the waterskin, and folds into it a plum blossom.","name":"A Weathered Snow Hat","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30135","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30115","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30155","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_4083_chimes":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Wind Chimes","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30061","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30012","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"31023","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30073","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":4},{"id":"30042","count":4},{"id":"30032","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":3},{"id":"31054","count":7},{"id":"31023","count":16}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_atk_up[3]","icon":"skcom_atk_up[3]","name":"ATK Up γ","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31044","count":3},{"id":"30013","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31064","count":3},{"id":"30054","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_chimes_2","icon":"skchr_chimes_2","name":"Longing for Home","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31034","count":3},{"id":"31044","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_chimes","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"CRU","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_chimes","description":"'These are the only remaining towns and villages in the mountains.

Traveling in the rain can be dangerous. My horn, err... I learned this the hard way. As for wild beasts or bandits, stay calm. It's no big deal. I can handle them, and if you're taking over my route, you can too.\n'Finally, there are some special paths that are rarely used—I'm running out of space, so I'll write the rest on a separate sheet.

the time class let out, the sun is already setting. Hoederer looks out the window at the deep orange sun, hanging low on the city's edge. Its gentle light filters through gaps in the clouds, illuminating the Babel flag fluttering, mirroring the flag of the Military Commission opposite it. He feels a rare stir of emotion—Kazdel, his broken yet vibrant hometown, was about to settle peacefully into slumber. This was a scene he had only imagined as a child; he couldn't even remember how many times he'd dreamed of it coming true—hundreds? Maybe more?\nIn the empty room, a knock at the door interrupts his thoughts. He opens it to see a stranger.\n'Mr. Hoederer, General Manfred has invited you to pay him a visit,' the stranger says.\n'I haven't touched base with the Military Commission in a long time.'\n'The General understands. He said you might need some time,' the visitor continues. 'I'm only here as his messenger.'\nManfred... the current head of the Military Commission, who had played a role in Kazdel's development...\n'The General also said that if you refused, he'd come see you himself next time,' the messenger adds, before Hoederer can respond.\nManfred, he thinks, lowering his head. The streetlights are starting to come on, and he sees both the messenger and his own shadow begin to blur.\n'Please, go back,' he says to the visitor. 'We'll find time to visit the General, but not today.' Then he closes the door.\nHoederer turns around and speaks to the shadows in the empty classroom. 'Welcome back.'\n'Hmph.' A figure emerges from the shadows, her back turned to Hoederer. She starts to clean the classroom.\n'You hesitated.' Ines remarks.\n'I... some things are complicated.'\n'Including your feelings on them.'\n'Right.'\n'You're not denying it.'\n'Right.'\n'...'\n'I told you, our top priority right now is saving enough money to open up that shop you always wanted,' Hoederer says. 'The rest can wait.'\n'I know,' she says, pausing slightly. 'I've always known.'\nThen they leave together in silence, walking down the street. They look up at the twin gray-blue moons lighting the sky, casting a glow over Kazdel's old district, where ruined buildings stand resilient in the night. Rows of rusted, iron-roofed houses stretch endlessly, and red-brown fields reflect the flickering light from blazing furnaces. Crumbling roads twist through the hills and valleys, carrying the city's lifeblood—an unceasing flow of people—to their destinations.","name":"A New Life","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30155","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30145","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_4091_ulika":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"U-Official","profession":"Supporter","rarity":"TIER_1","skillLevelUpCosts":[],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":30,"evolveCost":[]}],"skills":[],"modules":[]},"char_4093_frston":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Friston-3","profession":"Defender","rarity":"TIER_1","skillLevelUpCosts":[],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":30,"evolveCost":[]}],"skills":[],"modules":[]},"char_4098_vvana":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Viviana","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30011","count":6},{"id":"30061","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30032","count":4},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30073","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30033","count":6},{"id":"30043","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":5},{"id":"30062","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":4}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":4},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":8}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_vvana_1","icon":"skchr_vvana_1","name":"Blade of Fleeting Shadows","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31064","count":4},{"id":"30033","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30074","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":10}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30145","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_vvana_2","icon":"skchr_vvana_2","name":"Shadowed by Candlelight","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30083","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31014","count":4},{"id":"31074","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30074","count":7}]]},{"id":"skchr_vvana_3","icon":"skchr_vvana_3","name":"'Flicker'","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30074","count":4},{"id":"30043","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30094","count":4},{"id":"30054","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"31074","count":5}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_vvana","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"AFT","type":"D","icon":"uniequip_002_vvana","description":"Multiple people have opined to me at length about what they think of Nova Knightclub's 'plans', how my 'vacation' might signal the Knightclub's future decisions, and so on and so forth. Still, as the Grand Knight Territory and its ghastly white glowing metal walls faded beyond the horizon, all those speculations lost their meaning.\nIn my mind, I was simply being sent to yet another place not of my choosing. The silver lining, at least, is that I don't hate it here. Every morning in Ognisko, all the workshops fire up their furnaces at almost the same time, and the blacksmiths all hail each other good morning over the clamor of fire and metal. It's an organic, living noise that pays no heed to what outsiders bring or take away.\nI took up assistant duties in an arms workshop to stave off the boredom. Orders are always coming in from Kawalerielki, with plenty of familiar names attached. Nova is now raising a 'Moonlight Knight' who uses a sword made of fluid alloy—I only later found out they swapped those red wine baths and handsome manservants for moonlight hammocks and silver-furred manglerbeast sidekicks. In contrast, the blacksmith at my workshop never asks which knight she's forging for, nor does she care who I am—be it the Candle Knight or a commoner—and isn't concerned whether her weapons go to competition knights or barren mercenaries. She never reads the 'knight persona' briefing attached to any of her orders.\nBut she does care about her craft. Sometimes, I'll stop and admire the fire in the hearth, and she'll proudly recount the tale of how the first fire came from the heavens. It fell to the land in its divinity, and where it fell the land was blessed with metal, and thus the craft of smelting and forging was born. 'Shame,' she said once, 'that nobody believes any of it now.'\nI told her that when I was very young, I saw fire falling from the heavens. She listened, and then she laughed, sensing how cursory my words were, how I was trying to save her from embarrassment. Changing the subject, she asked if I'd like to raise the ceiling's workshop a little, so I wouldn't have to walk everywhere stooped over. I declined, and she said no more.\nAs if by coincidence, on my second day, a radio program came on with an astronomical report, forecasting a meteor over Ognisko. After all the furnaces in town went out that night, the blacksmith and I stood by the workshop door, and saw blue ripples across the sky. According to an old folksong, those are made as the meteors stir the starpod, though this meteor remained hidden behind the hills.\nThe blacksmith's eyes were all aglow. Her feet set in motion, as if to chase that blazing light.\nAfter running some distance, she turned to look back at me.\n'Aren't you coming?'\n'I'm fine watching from here. The ripples its tail leaves in the sky are beautiful, too.'\nI did lie, in a way, when I told her I'd seen fire falling to the ground as a child. It was true a meteor crossed Sturmland's skies, but only the window on the wrong side was opened in my room. I didn't want to wake Father and beg him to take me outside. I never saw a meteor that evening, and so instead I clutched my ice-cold binoculars and told myself, 'It's fine. The ripples its tail leaves in the sky are beautiful, too.'\nAnd no, I was never in denial about just how achingly stunning the blazing glint of the meteor itself could be. I just never spoke of it. Just as every time I light a candle, I see only the shadow beneath it.\nThe blacksmith vanished into the night. I looked all around, and saw the burdenbeast tethered by the workshop door. In all the knight novels, Kuranta knights could cross entire prairies on their own two feet, never in need of a steed. <i>But I am no Kuranta, and right now, no knight either</i>—This thought crossed my mind as I mounted the burdenbeast and rode off, chasing where the meteor had vanished.","name":"The Unforeseeable","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30135","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30155","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_4100_caper":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Caper","profession":"Sniper","rarity":"TIER_4","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":2}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30021","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30032","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30042","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"31063","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30093","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":45,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":60,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3241","count":3},{"id":"30032","count":1},{"id":"30022","count":1}]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3242","count":5},{"id":"30063","count":11},{"id":"31083","count":7}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_caper_1","icon":"skcom_powerstrike[2]","name":"Power Strike β","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"30104","count":1},{"id":"30023","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"31044","count":2},{"id":"31034","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30145","count":2},{"id":"30074","count":2}]]},{"id":"skchr_caper_2","icon":"skchr_caper_2","name":"Double the Fun","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"31054","count":1},{"id":"30093","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30084","count":2},{"id":"30014","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30155","count":2},{"id":"31034","count":1}]]}],"modules":[]},"char_4102_threye":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Valarqvin","profession":"Supporter","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30021","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30013","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31043","count":3},{"id":"30033","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3271","count":4},{"id":"30062","count":3},{"id":"30022","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3273","count":3},{"id":"30014","count":10},{"id":"30063","count":7}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_threye_1","icon":"skchr_threye_1","name":"Before All I See Collapses","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"30093","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":3},{"id":"30064","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"31054","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_threye_2","icon":"skchr_threye_2","name":"After All I See Has Withered","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30054","count":3},{"id":"30013","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"30094","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30155","count":4},{"id":"31024","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_threye","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"RIT","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_threye","description":"It's just a plain crystal, Arges can see that.\nHowever, the trader not far away was touting it as the be all and end all, something about a Snowpriest's Originium Arts, Samivilinn's ward, the Cyclops' first choice...

When the ranch owner takes Helena to see the burdenbeast that evening, this is the first thought that crosses her mind.\nThe burdenbeast stands proud in the corral, its stocky build much larger than any burdenbeast Helena has ever tamed. Fresh scars mar its face and neck, while a fading name is branded onto the side of its belly by hot iron, making it seem particularly extraordinary.\nExtraordinary—an apt word to describe what the burdenbeast has endured. The ranch owner tells Helena that it took the hunters quite some effort to capture it. Tracking the beast alone took five days, as its tracks led them across mountains and valleys, through forests and creeks, almost straight into a full-on Catastrophe. Only after almost wearing out their boots and exhausting all their tranquilizer arrows did they finally manage to bring this legendary burdenbeast back. Many renowned riders have since tried to tame it, all to no avail.\n'What a fine beast,' Helena exclaims.\n'That's right. That's why you're our last hope at taming it,' the ranch owner responds, sounding slightly defeated. 'If even you can't tame it, I'll have no choice but to send it to the slaughterhouse.'\nHelena takes out the bridle and vaults over the fence.\nShe advances slowly and gently towards the burdenbeast until they are less than half a meter apart. In one hand, she holds the bridle; with the other, she caresses its face, fingers tracing the new and old scars. Before anyone can react, she slips the bridle over its neck, tightens the reins, and effortlessly flips onto the beast's back.\nThe ranch owner's gasp is instantly drowned out by the beast's deafening neighs. Helena quickly steadies herself, holding tightly onto the reins no matter how hard the beast kicks and shakes. Enraged, the beast rears up on its hind legs and lets out a furious cry. Helena leans forward, pressing her body entirely against its back. Despite all these years, even as its mane has hardened and its hide has grown rough, the vigor and life force of the wild still course through its veins.\nHelena recalls the evening of her seventeenth birthday. Her father had given her a burdenbeast as a present and had used a hot iron to brand its name onto the side of its belly. 'Anna.'\n'Anna. What a fine beast.' That was what Helena had thought.\nDiscreetly, Helena takes out a dagger from her pocket and, with a gentle nick, cuts the rein. With all its strength, 'Anna' shakes off the bridle and Helena. For a fleeting moment, Helena feels as if their gazes meet, though she cannot be sure. Half a second later, 'Anna' clears the fence with a single leap.\n'Holy! You nearly had it, Helena!' The ranch owner's tone is a mix of excitement and shame.\n'What a fine beast.' That's all Helena says as she gets back up, pats the dirt off herself, and watches as the burdenbeast gallops back into the wild.","name":"'Unbridled'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31024","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_4105_almond":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Almond","profession":"Specialist","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30051","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30062","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30012","count":8}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"31033","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30023","count":3},{"id":"31053","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3281","count":4},{"id":"30032","count":5},{"id":"30042","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3283","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":6},{"id":"30083","count":13}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_almond_1","icon":"skchr_almond_1","name":"Magnetic Grab","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30023","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31034","count":3},{"id":"30054","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"31044","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_almond_2","icon":"skchr_almond_2","name":"Power Traction","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31044","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"31064","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"31034","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_almond","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"HOK","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_almond","description":"'Liskarm, what's this cake doing here?'\n'From HR, for the newcomer.'\n'Oh, you mean that engineering specialist they got?

You're only here because you were after them, right? How could you not know?'\n'Suppose my boss was lying by omission then,' Verdant sighs. 'He said, there's carnivorous plants snapping about in the depths of the Acahuallan jungle. Keep one indoors, sorts out your Originium slug problem just like that.

Like wafting a breeze to put out a candle, it extinguishes; the Spire's study turns to dusk hues, with only the light of the setting sun coming through the window.\nEvening falls over Zwillingstürme, the sound of music filtering like mist through the Spire's generous walls. It is profound and yet murky, not at all there, yet opaque to the senses. Micha recognizes the piece; Bach's 12th Symphony 'Abendrot', 3rd movement, performed by the Fortsgard Philharmonic Orchestra. From the style, possibly conducted by Ricercar, yet also reminiscent of Graf Lotzmann—is he still allowed into Zwillingstürme these days? Grimmacht had already sent him off to the Black Manor, thirteen months ago. It was Micha himself who delivered the documents...\nA muffled noise ripples past his ear, one he's all too familiar with: his Originium Arts. Silent soundwaves transmit outwards from him, pushing the sound of 'Abendrot' away, until every corner of the study is encompassed. The room is soundproofed, and Micha's mind is proofed from the chaos of any lingering thoughts.\nMicha picks up the pair of castanets, much heavier than any ordinary kind, made of thicker, sturdier wood. On top, the inlaid—well, what used to be inlaid gold thread was gilded with no regard for acoustics, which already ruined the castanets' original timbre, not to mention the oversized gemstones. Thanks to those, they come off as ornate, respectable, no longer capable of the sound they were meant to make. They qualify no longer as an instrument, but an exceptional gift instead, and an exceptional trinket.\nMicha has never really treasured this reward since it was bestowed to him. He doesn't want an instrument permanently stripped of its proper sound—and he knows the one who gave them to him meant it in exactly that way. That's why the castanets scare him, why he detests them, why they prick at him at practically every turn.\nHe won't take them up; he'd rather regard them as a trinket, a child's plaything, to be willfully handled until the gold thread falls off, their formerly sleek black surface riddled with scratches. He once even thought of throwing them away, into the hills, into the wind, back into that curdled-stiff afterglow.\n'You must keep them by your side. Can a toy hurt you? You must keep them by your side, to prove that you and them are different. Not for Lupukarn, but for yourself.' The voice sounds so close to him, but in truth it is further than any other voice could be. Micha knows that that voice is the reason he's kept them. He remembers, gazing at that Spire, how the black shadow it cast would always keep him strong.\nMicha looks out of the window, and all he sees is the golden afterglow.","name":"Bestowed Trinket","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"31034","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31044","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31054","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_411_tomimi":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Tomimi","profession":"Caster","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30061","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30103","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30063","count":2},{"id":"31013","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3251","count":4},{"id":"30022","count":4},{"id":"30032","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3253","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":8},{"id":"30013","count":14}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_tomimi_1","icon":"skchr_tomimi_1","name":"Tribal Techniques","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31014","count":3},{"id":"30013","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"30064","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30104","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_tomimi_2","icon":"skchr_tomimi_2","name":"Gavial's Protection Plan","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"31023","count":1}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30064","count":2},{"id":"30044","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30064","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_tomimi","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"CCR","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_tomimi","description":"(Relaxing music)\n'Hello there.

Everything around me has become unfamiliar as can be...'\nDawn. By the soft glow of the campfire's dying embers, Delphine writes the first sentence in her diary entry, then halts, suddenly realizing how it's been almost a year since the close of that great Londinium war. When she first went over Victoria's borderlands, then a knight-errant, she discovered iniquity in spades that had scant weighed on her before, so as time passed, her sword became a habit, dispensing the justice she felt right.\nThus, when she learns of a still nearby band of Sarkaz vagrants disquieting the locals and looting wherever they please, she finds a destination. 'Perhaps just more wretches who found the war had ended before they even made it to Londinium.'\n'Help me...'\nEyes following the voice, she looks back. A young Feline girl pokes her head out from the shadows.\nShaking, the girl points to the far black horizon, whereupon Delphine finally catches sight of the blade-wielding figures, four in total. They approach.\n'It's devils, the lot of them. Could you get me home?' the girl asks.\nFrom its hefty scabbard, Delphine draws what was once her mother's saber, through which courses Originium Arts. Their glow casts light on the girl's frightened face, shallow scars and black crystals thrown into sharp relief.\nThe distant figures pause, then not a moment later turn to leave, and disappear back into the dark of the horizon.\n'You want me to take you home?'\nBriefly, the girl hesitates. Without the courage to meet Delphine's fierce gaze, she merely hangs her head and nods.\nYet once back at the camp, they are refused at the gate. The camp's leader is wary, on guard against Delphine who follows the girl closely.\nAnd Delphine needs but a glance to see how the camp's Feline Infected gather, whips stowed at the ready, trying to hide the Sarkaz children quaking in terror.\nDelphine's fury ignites. 'You make an innocent child pretend she's hunted. You trick countless people to this camp, only to hurt them.'\n'Be on your way.' Delphine lets the girl go, then singles out the leader. 'You, with me. There will be a price to pay for the innocents you've hurt.'\n'I'm only helping my people out.'\nDelphine shakes her head. 'That's no excuse. Have you given any thought to how these children will be when they grow up?'\nShe takes the leader far away, far enough that no eye in the camp could reach them.\n'I'll contact Rhodes Island to assist them. Now, en garde.'\nOn her 231st day on field assignment, Delphine bears a scabbard with one scar more, and sallies forth for a direction that leaves Victoria only further behind.","name":"Gloomy Justice","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"31014","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31044","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31054","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_4114_harold":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Harold","profession":"Medic","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30041","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30062","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"31083","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31023","count":3},{"id":"30053","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3261","count":4},{"id":"30022","count":5},{"id":"30062","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3263","count":3},{"id":"31064","count":8},{"id":"30013","count":14}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_heal_up[3]","icon":"skcom_heal_up[3]","name":"Healing Up γ","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31054","count":3},{"id":"30063","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"31044","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"30104","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_harold_2","icon":"skchr_harold_2","name":"Triage","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30054","count":3},{"id":"31033","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"31084","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30155","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":2}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_harold","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"WDM","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_harold","description":"Lisburn,\nI received the Legs Care Kit you so kindly sent my way. It works splendidly! This old soldier, with but one leg to his name, no longer must weather the winter's bite in agony. But I must admit, I was taken aback to learn it hails from the pharmaceutical venture recently founded by Freya's brother. Why, that poor lad was still dwelling in squalor when I was on assignment in Kjerag! It seems he's amassed quite a fortune from peddling his medicines to the Victorians, hasn't he? A new company and all its trappings!\nHowever, upon scrutinizing the spray's formula, I couldn't help but notice its striking resemblance to the concoction I once used for mending fractures on burdenbeasts. Just a few additional herbs from Kjerag, and it performs like no other remedy I've encountered. Truly, you must be under Kjeragandr's divine protection.\nEverything good with you and Freya? How is the burdenbeast rental business going? You mentioned plans to build an abode by the Lake Silberneherze—why have I not yet seen any photographs of this endeavor? I eagerly await the day I can pay a visit to you both. And some good news: I spoke with the Chief of the Silverash Family about you and Freya, and I am pleased to report he did not oppose your union. Live your lives well, my friend.\nSpeaking of which, I find it quite difficult to fathom the intricacies of a Kjerag wedding. Forgive my curiosity, but do you exchange your vows by the serene waters of Lake Silberneherze or in Hoff Angrsaal? Before the revered statue of Kjeragandr? Must the parents of the betrothed be present as well? Regardless, I wish you a joyous marriage. And should any of your burdenbeasts suffer a broken leg once more, simply let me know.\nAfter all, when people's fortune in war is as grim as mine, we have no other choice but to help each other 'replant legs', and carry on. I may be a noble, but a fancy hat does not change the nature of this hapless creature underneath. I may possess the knowledge to mend the limbs of burdenbeasts, yet I remain at a loss when it comes to mending my own, or those of others. Allow this old cripple to extend his pity to his 'own kind'—Might you, through your pharmaceutical connections, explore whether there are other Victorian soldiers in need of their legs 'replanted'?\nI earnestly hope that, in the near future, everyone may walk on strong, healthy legs.\nHarold","name":"Legs Care Kit","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"31034","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30084","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_4116_blkkgt":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Degenbrecher","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30031","count":6},{"id":"30041","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30052","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"31083","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30053","count":6},{"id":"30073","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":5},{"id":"30022","count":8},{"id":"30032","count":5}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":4},{"id":"30155","count":3},{"id":"30094","count":7}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_blkkgt_1","icon":"skchr_blkkgt_1","name":"Pure Force","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31024","count":4},{"id":"30033","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":10}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30064","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_blkkgt_2","icon":"skchr_blkkgt_2","name":"Silent Derision","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31074","count":5},{"id":"30053","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"31034","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"31044","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_blkkgt_3","icon":"skchr_blkkgt_3","name":"Return To Silence","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31064","count":4},{"id":"30043","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"31024","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"31034","count":5}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_blkkgt","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"SWO","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_blkkgt","description":"Among Degenbrecher's luggage is a case exclusively for storing her medals.

Design makes it immediately clear that Kazimierz tailored this champion's medal to her. She reigned for three straight years and so was given three, but only the first was personally awarded to her by the Grand Knight after usurping the defender. Which is why she didn't throw it away, and why it's the one artifact of Kazimierz she still carries with her.\n'Commemorative enough, barely.'\n- 'Thanks'\nInverted triangle inscribed with Kjerag's holy Mount Karlan.

All of Karlan Trade knows that those wearing this medal are free to act unimpeded wherever Karlan Trade is concerned. Initially a pass designed expressly for her by Enciodes, but as soon became apparent, nobody simply overlooks the presence of Degenbrecher.

Human Resources is currently collaborating with Field Operations to investigate.\nDay Two\nWhile the Field Operations team conducts searches, we have also reviewed Ray's recent activities. On the night before her disappearance, she attended a private dance, which we consider to be abnormal behavior. We interviewed Alanna, Ray's friend and an intern at the Workshop, for more details. Below is an excerpt from our interview:\n'To think a weirdo like her went to a dance! I would never have believed it was her, but her cookie-shaped bangs were too iconic.'\n'What did she do at the dance?'\n'Umm... She just sat in a corner. Now that's more like something she'd do.'\n'Did she get into contact with anyone during the dance?'\n'Well, there was this old lady with a cane who sat in the corner with her.'\n'Did they interact in any way?'\n'That's the strange part! Neither of them spoke at all. It was as if they weren't at a dance, but sitting in a sauna house!'\nDay Three\nAccording to our investigation, the elderly woman whom Ray interacted with is a retired Operator from the Logistics Department currently on Rhodes Island for Oripathy treatment. She provided the following explanation for her attendance at the dance:\nShe used to be a dance teacher in her youth but had to end her career prematurely due to Oripathy. Now, severe crystallization of her left leg requires her to use a cane for walking.\nStatement from Retired Operator: 'All I wanted was to see young people dance.'\nDay Four\nAfter another futile day of searching, the search party witnessed two 'blue ghosts' as they were about to return. The Field Operators quickly assumed battle formations but broke formation after carefully probing said 'ghosts' with Arts: One of them was Ray.\nNext to Ray was a wasteland burdenbeast, its thick skin folds glistening with a blue hue as it heaved and twisted its massive body, as if dancing. Ray, also covered in a blue light, remained motionless. However, she was smiling like a child—a rare sight.\n[Supplementary Information]\nRay later learned that the blue light came from the dust pheromone of the Fluorescent Originium Slug, which causes intolerable irritation upon contact with the skin. This explained why the burdenbeast appeared to be dancing; in reality, it was writhing in itchiness. As for why Ray could remain unaffected by the itch... her 'excellent' rating in physical resilience is well-deserved. Below is an excerpt from our interview with her:\n'So, why did you suddenly leave the ship?'\n'I wanted to find the big burdenbeasts on the Colombian wasteland and make them dance to the moon again.'\n'Err... Did this have anything to do with the dance you attended? Was it because of the old lady who sat next to you?'\n'Yes. Her eyes showed me that she wanted to dance. So I suddenly felt that it was time to let the burdenbeasts dance again.'\n'... Huh?'\n'Yup.'\n'Well, umm, did you ever meet that old lady again? Maybe you'd like to tell her about your experience?'\n'No... but you're right, that'd be nice.

Were it not for the strong wind that guided him to the shore's embrace, were it not for the sharp, attentive eyes of the farmer hauling sandbags, a babe of not even two years would surely have met with disaster. The Tianshis and the farmers had discussed arrangements for him throughout the night, sent for instructions from the Ministry of Revenue, and even dispatched a Messenger to head directly upstream. However, that year the north had suffered floods after a great drought, while the south was buffeted by a vicious Catastrophe, and so the search for his parents had borne no fruit.\nSince then, he was known as He Sheng, and he was considered born in Dahuang.\nHe grew up atop the crop ridges. He grew up by the water pumps. He grew up on top of the mobile greenhouse frames. He grew up in the Tianshi dormitories and the farmers' courtyards. He grew up in the service channels between the artificial canals. He remembered Tianshi Shu giving palm readings to the children his age, then dabbing a drop of wine onto their foreheads. He remembered sitting atop the backs of stockbeasts alongside Grain Buds, surveying the container ships reminiscent of small mountains slowly entering the waterways, leaving for distant Baizao, Shangshu, or perhaps Danyan to the north. He also remembered one time that an experimental field of high-sugar crops spontaneously combusted, and Dahuang was filled with the inescapable sickly-sweet scent of boiling syrup for a month.\nHe Sheng rubs his eyes and spots the old farmers he's known since childhood rushing towards him.

All he could remember was that a spear had embedded itself into a tree trunk, and then he was bound by a rope that had suddenly dropped out of the sky, after which he found himself suspended above a riverside cliff.\n'Zhan Yan, male, Feline, from the eastern side of Jiangqi.'\nUpon hearing these words, the trussed-up villain stares at the young man who said them. All he sees is a Phidia youth clad in black, carrying a long box and walking alone atop the precipice.\n'You have collaborated with the Shanhaizhong, gathering in the wilderness as part of your sinister schemes... As chief among them, are you aware of which of Yan's laws you have broken?'\n'Pah! You think a limp-wristed bureaucrat like you with hardly a hair on his chest can scare me? I'll kill you, right here, right now!'\nThe river mist scatters, and the moonlight shines upon the 'bureaucrat's' iron mask.\n'Son of a-! You-You're a Sui Regulator Candleholder!' Zhan Yan's entire body breaks out into a cold sweat.\n'Since you are aware of the Sui Regulators, then you must also be aware that...' The youth takes a single step forward. 'While colluding with the Shanhaizhong, you have committed no small number of grisly and violent murders. A Candleholder has the authority to act as a substitute for a formal trial under the Three Organs of Justice, and may render their judgement on the spot.'\nThe wind blows—\nZhan Yan too was no ordinary man, and grits his teeth in defiance, waiting for the opportune moment when the Candleholder approached to hoist his body up, throwing out a fierce and mighty 'Daogua Jinzhong' kick! His dagger-like toe claw lets out a howling wind, coming dangerously close to the youth's throat while slicing apart the rope holding him aloft. The imposing villain shrugs off his tattered bonds, leaping down into a passing fishing boat below the cliff and grabbing the steersman by the arm.\n'Get this boat moving! Faster, dammit!' The boat's engine sputters to life, picking up speed as it leaves the riverbank. Thanks to his daring escape from a summary execution by the Sui Regulator, Zhan Yan can't help but proudly look back at the clifftop.\nWith the aid of the boat's aft lanterns, he clearly sees the black-clad youth take a deep breath before using the momentum of kicking off from the cliff edge to fly midair for twenty-odd zhang in a flash. The waves of the river are dotted with a multitude of white flowers, and he looks to all the world like an onyx leaf blown by a great gale, quietly landing aboard the boat.\nThe box opens, and the youth lightly clasps his scabbard.\n'This is Sui Regulator business. You will be compensated as per the law once I am done here.'\n'You—'\nZhan Yan begins to open his mouth, but is quickly shut up by the lanterns on either side of the boat being neatly sliced off by the youth's sword. The straight and sharp longsword stirs up fragments of glass in the dark, causing Zhan Yan's heart, still leaping wildly from his daring escape, to calm into icy terror. The cutting edge has not yet descended. Instead, like a lance, the youth kicks past the steersman's shoulder, his foot implanting itself into the villain's throat. Zhan Yan feels all the strength leave his body and he slams backwards onto the boat's deck, a warm river of fear between his thighs. Just before losing consciousness, he finally clearly sees the deep green eyes behind the iron mask, dark as the new moon, alongside the golden words inscribed on the inside of the box, only seen when fetching the sword—\n'Candle Bright, Stay Shining.

These so-called 'social activities' keep dragging me back to Dahuang. Not only does the weather not suit me, I can barely understand their accent, and I heard that their pickled vegetables are super super salty! I don't know how I'm going to make it an entire year.\nAs I expected, nothing's gone right since I arrived. I thought I could at least talk to people, but I keep tripping over my own tongue. Not only can nobody understand a word I say, but the stockbeasts keep running away from me!\n\nMay 21st\nI've run into a strange young girl, standing tiptoe atop the backs of the stockbeasts. She jumped around on top of them, and at first glance you'd think she was a fowlbeast that had fallen into the herd. There I was, one leg sunk deep in the mud while my other foot is barely covered, trudging through the muck, when she started laughing at me.\n'Sillyhead!', she said.\nMe...?\n'Take off your shoes!'\nEh?\n'I'll teach you how to walk on top of the stockbeasts so you don't have to go through the mud.'\nI got thrown off the stockbeasts' backs eight times that day, and I'm sure I ate more mud than rice by dinner time. She thumped me across my back, her plumage flapping about as she laughed. Though my luck may be bad, looking at her smiling face makes me feel that there's nothing that can hold me down for long.\n\nJuly 8th\nThat girl was crouching down by the stockbeast pen this time, swaying her head as she played her flute to the herd.\n'Hey, Claypot! Come, quick!'\nWho...?\n'You're new here, right Claypot? I forgot to tell you last time, but my name's Grain Buds!'\nOh, was she talking to me?\n'Do you want to learn how to talk to stockbeasts? I'd say I'm better at it than anyone in all of Yan!'\nShe held my face in one hand, while holding a stockbeast's in the other, and told us to look into each other's eyes. That day might be the first time I realized a stockbeast's bright, intelligent eyes possess the same basic range of emotions as any man. Since then, the stockbeasts really did stop running away from the sound of my voice. I never expected someone like me—who's always getting chased and nipped by tuskbeasts—to suddenly have a group of animal friends.\n\nOctober 4th\nI was out searching for Grain Buds when I ran into her along with another youth who appeared to be a schoolboy. They were playing some odd game where they threw small pieces of bone.\n'Claypot! Come play with us!'\nOh, alright...\n'He's 'Big Buffalo', have you two not met before?'\nI'm afraid not...\n'These were left over from Shu's stew! I don't really know all the rules myself, so you'll have to explain, Big Buffalo!'\nI had no idea that you could turn stockbeast leg bones into toys. A shame I was so clumsy, though. I couldn't catch the bones for quite a long while, and kept accidentally flinging them at their heads instead. Big Buffalo was a nice guy. Didn't talk much, just like me. However, every time he went off to work, he wanted to bring me along. Sometimes Grain Buds would lie down on a stockbeast's back, or hang from a tree. Sometimes she would help us out with work, and other times she would drag us off to play. Out here in the boundless fields, it almost felt like we were a family.\n\nMay 20th\nAs I was leaving Dahuang by car, a group of stockbeasts wandering the fields walked past. Looking at their chubby figures fade into the distance behind us, I suddenly began to feel uneasy, just like I did a year ago when I left home by myself to come to Dahuang. Setting aside not being able to see Dahuang's fields and stockbeasts any longer, would I be able to find friends as good as Grain Buds and Big Buffalo at school? I don't know how I'm going to make it through the next two school years.","name":"On the Field","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30094","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31014","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_4123_ela":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Ela","profession":"Specialist","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30011","count":6},{"id":"30061","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30032","count":4},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"31073","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30013","count":6},{"id":"30053","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3281","count":5},{"id":"30062","count":5},{"id":"30012","count":7}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3283","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":7}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_ela_1","icon":"skchr_ela_1","name":"Optical Interference","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31014","count":4},{"id":"31033","count":9}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"31044","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"31034","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_ela_2","icon":"skchr_ela_2","name":"Shock Defense","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31044","count":4},{"id":"31073","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31084","count":4},{"id":"31024","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"31044","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_ela_3","icon":"skchr_ela_3","name":"'The Bosak Tempest'","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30084","count":4},{"id":"30093","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30084","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":9}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30145","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_ela","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"TRP","type":"D","icon":"uniequip_002_ela","description":"One day...\n'Myrinia was precisely in need of these medicines, Rhodes Island mercenary madam.

We would be glad to pay you, but... we cannot bring you with us.'\nSo elaborates an elderly Feline woman, sat in the shade of a wagon's canopy. Beside her lies a light and dirtied mattress, upon which a Lupo man about her age writhes, limbs as if tied in knots. But his face is peaceful enough, and his sweat has more or less subsided—effects of the medicine.\n'Don't worry, I promise I won't hold you up. I may even be able to help you further.'\nA tan-skinned middle-aged man continues to try and persuade him. He has no obvious racial characteristics, rendering him slightly mysterious.\n'Look, we get disasters on this route all the time. That's why it's all us old folks running it. Why should you have to risk it?'\n'There's a Catastrophe Messenger in town; I have a map he drew. Your destination should be within comms range of that city. If this is about safety, then all the more reason I should come with you.'\n'We... but we only have enough water and rations for ourselves.

If we leave first, you won't have a ride back to Siracusa for quite a while.'\n'Doesn't matter, I'll rendezvous with my friends in the city... I just insist on finding my way there alone, that's all.

We're used to it. But why should you have to?'\nGustave Kateb lifts his head and gazes in the direction he's bound for. He cannot see anything resembling a road, and though he hears that it's a gargantuan structure that spits earth, smoke, and dust and is assembled from an array of nomadic plates, no city has yet entered his vision. Only the haze of sand and ash on the horizon, reflected in eyes of the same shade.\n'You're not wrong. I still know far too little about this place, and my past experience won't always apply. Even if I'm prepared physically, I have no basis to claim I'm ready mentally.\n'But time is short, and there's too much to do. Overthinking this gets me nowhere. So stop trying to talk me out of it and let's go.'\nThe city's name is Kazdel. To him, the place is completely unfamiliar. Even its name cannot be found in the land of his birth.\nBut that does not matter. He is a doctor. Whether at home or afar, he is always pressed to go to wherever needs him most.","name":"'The Third Power'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"31044","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30104","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_4126_fuze":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Fuze","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30061","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30012","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30033","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31033","count":3},{"id":"30093","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":4},{"id":"30042","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":3},{"id":"31024","count":8},{"id":"30023","count":16}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_fuze_1","icon":"skchr_fuze_1","name":"Force Recon","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31044","count":3},{"id":"30103","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31044","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"30064","count":2}]]},{"id":"skchr_fuze_2","icon":"skchr_fuze_2","name":"Cluster Charge","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31064","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31074","count":3},{"id":"30074","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30155","count":4},{"id":"31074","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_fuze","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"CEN","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_fuze","description":"'Buddy, you are NOT a chatty type, huh!'\nAfter the gazillionth attempt to start up a conversation without getting a reaction, the Cautus worker in a yellow pair-o'-ears helmet stops operating his control panel and gives the man beside him a pat on the shoulders. With the machine kicked into auto anyway, it's not like it needs nannying.\nSeeming to recognize as much, the man finally turns his head. His eyes are hidden behind a black visor, barely discernible. He remains silent, and simply extends two fingers on his right hand and gives his own helmet a few taps.\n'Go on and say somethin', will ya? Saaaaay—woooords—'\nThroughout this temporary worksite echoes the rumble of Originium electronics, more often than not a soundboard to rival a nomadic plate's engine layer. But the voicebox of a Rim Billy worker, like the workers themselves, is filled with a power that cuts through just about everything.\nThe man appears a little confused. He feels around behind him, then unexpectedly pulls out a mirror. He takes a glance at his own reflection, then raps on his helmet again in the same manner as before.\nThe worker doesn't get to respond before he sees, out of nowhere on the man's visor, a smiley face positioned right between where his eyes would be. There's a line of Victorian text below too, split by his nose into halves. The left side reads 'I'M SHY,' and the right, 'AND QUIET.'\nThe worker tries as hard as he can to keep a straight face. His lower lip twitches side to side, his teeth grind over each other, and he doesn't leak a single word.\nBut soon, he can't hold in anymore, snorts, and begins to laugh.\n'Probe has reached scheduled depth. Drill decelerating. Prepare to turn off and take samples.'\nThat's an announcement from Control Center 2. It sits 80m straight above them, and 50m above that are the natural caves of Camp 2 and tracks to the auxiliary shafts. Another 600m up is the surface, and outside from there are the Targangils Mountains for miles and miles forever.\nThe drill mentioned in the announcement is a fair way deeper into the earth than they are.\n'—Hold on, Number 2 is too deep. Abnormal tremors in 2's shaft walls. Calling emergency stop!' The second announcement comes hot on the heels of the first, as if some kind of prank.\nSomething unwelcome has been welcomed. The worker throws himself onto the control panel, pounding a fist on the largest, roundest red button of them all. It's the one to emergency-dump the drill and inject extra polymer prep into the shaft walls.\nBut the injector doesn't respond, and the Originium electronics continue to roar.\nA ginormous thud echoes through the worksite, seemingly not from deeper depths, but from times long, long ago.\nOne thud becomes two, then three, then a string of them. The two watch as even the wall outside them finally begins to experience its own fierce tremors.\nNumber 2 has drilled too deep and awakened something, and that something is heading for the sunlight.\n'Detonating all Cluster Charges!' The worker's never heard this voice before, but in an instant discerns that it has to be the man's shout.\nPerhaps because of this shout, or perhaps because of what it triggers elsewhere...\nThe tremors cease. Silence seems to reign again for a while, until there comes another announcement urging evacuation.\n'Your tender said 'use of Originium explosives forbidden', so here I am.'\nThis may be the second time the man's opened his mouth today, and his voice is far quieter than a moment ago.\n'There's issues with your emergency injector system.

He gently pulls aside the curtains of black silk—woven by his mother and the elders—around his small bed. He takes a while to get dressed, then quietly leaves the bedroom. He silently walks through the long stone corridor, across the open courtyard and road, and past the flickering candles and lights that stave off the darkness. On his way to the river, the oblique moonlight and faint firelight behind him cast a spattering of vague shadows around his feet. Everything around him becomes a part of the child's night adventure.\nDuring the day, when the sun's not hidden behind clouds, the Banshees will take the young and carefree Aefanyl to wander through valleys and fables. In the light-dappled woods, beneath the gaze of the towering mountains in the distance, they sing ancient epics and extol life's brilliance. Aefanyl, clad in splendorous robes, dances to the songs of the elders. Through these cadences passed down from thousands of years, he hears the footsteps of ancient heroes on their faraway journeys and the breathing of new shoots as they sprout from the trees. His thoughts rise and fall with the sun: this land is an extension of the Convallis, home to laughter and melodies without end.\nA cry draws his attention and jerks him back to reality. On the other side of the river, several tuskbeasts are dragging a cystybeast into the forest's depths, vanishing before he can take a good look. He hears his own panting, along with several strange sounds mixed with the gurgling of the river, as if something is being torn apart, then broken. It is a new language that Aefanyl has never heard before. It seems to contain certain emotions and connotations he has never experienced, and it begins to fill him with confusion.\nHe takes out the bone pen from his breast pocket—his birthday gift—and draws simple symbols in the air. They look like words but are little more than scribbles. He has his own way of recording this new language.\n'Our little hero's great adventure thus reaches its end.' The young Banshee turns his head and sees the dresses of the Banshee elders fluttering in the night, shimmering with the silken strands they had woven themselves.\n'Do you remember what we agreed upon, Aefanyl?'\n'I am not to use Arts while I am alone.'\n'Wonderful.' An older Banshee gently cups Aefanyl's chin and rubs his face with the base of her palm. 'Why, then, did you do what you just did?'\n'I wanted to understand, what the cystybeast was saying just now...' Aefanyl lowers his head, his right hand sliding behind his back as he grips the pen, gently pressing his thumb against its tip, as if trying to conceal it within his palm.\n'If I could figure out what it was saying, would that have prevented it from being taken away by the tuskbeasts? If I understood what it was saying, how it felt, would I have been able to help it and stop it from making that sad sound? I want it to know that someone cares.' Aefanyl recalls what he had just seen. Confusion becomes pain, and from pain comes a wish.\nIn an instant, everyone becomes quiet, and a breeze stirs.\n'From now on,' the Great Banshee Laqeramaline breaks the silence and steps forth from the crowd, 'our Aefanyl is free to go where he pleases, and practice as he pleases.' 'However,' his mother continues, 'it is now time to go to bed.'\n'Mother...' Aefanyl approaches his mother, and her hand lovingly clasp his.\nThe Banshees return the way they had come. Along the way, moonlight elongates Aefanyl's thin figure. They walk in silence, while the leaves of beech, fir, and pine trees rustle softly in the wind. Beneath the deep blue night sky and the misty gray clouds, the river quietly carries the floating light forward, like a crack of luminous light from a black valley, from which a gentle pulse of courage emerges.","name":"A Pen Collection from the Convallis","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30155","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_logos","cnOnly":true,"typeName1":"CCR","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_logos","description":"一本书平摊在桌上，逻各斯调整了一下放大镜，尝试用骨笔在文字上书写巫术。他所刻下的每一个咒文，会由设备放大投影于幕布上，再由Pith将其解读，写下其表意与隐意，然后让围坐一堂的术师们施展并讨论效果。\n这原本是罗德岛术师的兴趣班，不知从何时开始，变成了辅助逻各斯进行实验的研究团队。\n他正在做一件无用的事，为他那本暂时只在罗德岛内部流通的《语义范式百科》设计咒文，这些咒文将确保书内所有内容对应的正确意义显现在每一个阅览者的脑中。\n由于语言的意义会不断流变，他需要倾听尽量多的不同国家、种族、阶级的人对相同内容的理解，不断比对咒文原始意义与他人理解意义间的差别，随后去不断调整咒文，最终将之书写于纸张上。\n于是乌萨斯人、维多利亚人、萨卡兹、菲林、学院派、自由派，每个参加兴趣班的术师，需要先接过一本影印版百科，阅读受咒文影响的内容后，根据自己的理解施展一遍法术。这样，逻各斯便能捕捉其中最细微的差别，从而对咒文进行矫正。\n得益于Pith对源石技艺精准无误的复制与理解力，逻各斯可以放心地将转录、纠错与教学工作交给这位好战友，自己则能专注于实现每段内容的咒文效果。\n从最近获得的实验数据来看，近乎所有参加测试，阅读过施加咒文的《语义范式百科》段落的干员，都已经能准确传达出该段落的内容并施放法术。\n参加实验的术师们欣喜若狂，但逻各斯并没有陷入喜悦之中。\n这是否代表着，他获得了他想要的成果——将相同内容完全没有损耗地传递给所有人，他仍旧心存疑虑。\n这一行为所蕴含的可能，已经完全超出了萨卡兹巫术现代化的初衷，成为某种创造新语言的尝试。写下被标注的文字，想要传达的意义便不易被歪曲，而如果所有人都用其书写，那么，在最理想的情况下，信息传递的损耗将被降低到极限，千年后的人阅读这段文字，所能获取的信息将与现在别无二致。\n可这项工程何时能够完成，从中产生的东西最终能够促进打破一切使用源石技艺的隔阂，还是成为毁灭一切的催化剂？又或者，在花费了如此多的心血后，只能合上书本，任其成为图书馆中一本无人问津的著作？\n......\n参加讨论与实验的干员们来来去去，现在，整个房间里只剩下他一个人，提笔时，才发现骨笔已经因长时间的书写出现了裂痕。\n作为王庭之主，作为萨卡兹，他为卡兹戴尔编纂了第一本“大部头”，耐心等待它真正需要这部书的那一天。\n但作为罗德岛的一员，作为泰拉的一分子，他畅想生灵放下所有隔阂，将命运握在手中的时刻。为此，他要研究，他要尝试，哪怕那种梦想，眼下并没有实现的可能。\n哀珐尼尔换了一支新笔，开始了新一轮钻研。\n理想还活着，在他的心中，在他那纤细的笔杆上。","name":"《语义范式百科》","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30135","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30155","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_4134_cetsyr":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Civilight Eterna","profession":"Supporter","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30051","count":6},{"id":"30011","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30062","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30012","count":5},{"id":"30062","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"31023","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31013","count":4},{"id":"30063","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3271","count":5},{"id":"30042","count":7},{"id":"30022","count":5}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3273","count":4},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30084","count":6}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_cetsyr_1","icon":"skchr_cetsyr_1","name":"The Past Lingering","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"31023","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30094","count":4},{"id":"31064","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30155","count":6},{"id":"31074","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_cetsyr_2","icon":"skchr_cetsyr_2","name":"The Future Elusive","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31084","count":4},{"id":"31013","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31014","count":4},{"id":"30094","count":9}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"31084","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_cetsyr_3","icon":"skchr_cetsyr_3","name":"The Present Reconstructed","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31024","count":4},{"id":"30033","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31044","count":4},{"id":"30104","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30145","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_cetsyr","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"BAR","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_cetsyr","description":">ND_DWDB_READY\n>NEWUSER_CE\n>TIMEDATA_0106\nAmiya is simple.\nEncoding and saving everything about her takes less than a byte of internal memory.

The creation of coffee involves a complex process whereby the fruit of the coffee plant is processed multiple times using specific techniques, equipment, and procedures.\nThere are many detailed subcategories of coffee products by taste and quality, and the process of its usage is equally complex. Landwalkers consume coffee orally at specified times and occasions, with specific rules for how it is consumed.\nDespite being more harmful than typical neural stimulants, coffee appears to be far less effective. No obvious stimulation effects were observed after consuming ten standard portions of Siracusan espresso. How could such complex manufacturing and usage procedures lead to such a mild effect?\n...\nSystematic research has revealed that the manufacturing and usage of coffee is a terrestrial ritual. The meaning behind the complex manufacturing process is manifested in the form of taste of quality, and perceived by the user when consumed orally. Emphasis on a specific time and place asserts the solemnity of the ritual, while rules about consumption increases the sense of participation. The user is subject to a form of psychic suggestion to stay awake, which compensates for any deficiencies in actual potency.\nWhile the rituals involved are complex and difficult to comprehend, there may be lessons to be learned from the employment of psychic suggestion as a form of mental stimulation. Although the Institute of Development Planning will intervene in the event that an Ægir citizen overuses neural stimulations by rescheduling work or adjusting requirements, individual citizens, out of an obsession for their creative activities or personal values, may occasionally ignore the IDP's intervention and continue to administer neural stimulants in large quantities. While adjustive measures exist to deal with the circumstances of such citizens, there is a need for a less harmful form of neural stimulation to assist them during a creative fever. Progress has been made to reduce the side effects of neural stimulants through technological means, but perhaps we could also investigate the possibility of integrating terrestrial psychic suggestion into the use of neural stimulants, in order to achieve the same effect with a lower dosage...\nWe should leave some of the experiment results for him.

opens the heavy door that has shielded him from people's hostility for more than a decade. Absentmindedly, he grabs the beast teaser hanging behind the door and makes a few flicks towards the inside of the room.\nOne, two, three.\nThe newly-engraved gemstone on the tip of the teaser glows faintly, flickering against the darkness, yet the familiar figure doesn't appear as expected. Lazvar stops. It suddenly dawns on him that Mio is never going to magically emerge from nowhere and rush towards him again. Sighing deeply, he hangs the teaser back.\n'Click.' With a faint mechanical sound, soft light illuminates the depths of the room. Priceless gems, coveted even in Menat-Ha'mait, flood the bookshelves and desks, casting vibrant, colorful reflections. In this most secure and secretive room of the Grand Bazaar, they have silently painted an ethereal illusion.\nThese are the fruits of many years of hard work by Lazvar's family. To protect them from bandits and thieves, Lazvar has memorized the precise position of every brick in these four walls, even noting how they're covered by dust.\nBut none of that matters now, for he is finally going to put his long-carried mission aside and leave this place that has begun to paralyze his mind.\nBefore going, Lazvar needs to pack the most important things first. Wait, what are those things on the list again?\nOh yes, the portrait of Mio, Woof and him from a couple of years ago... Here, right behind the shelf. They persuaded him into getting one as a commemoration of coming-of-age, but after the portrait was completed, Woof insisted on hiding it here, claiming, 'Who has ever seen any beckbeast and cloudbeast as large as us!' Mio was so offended that they refused to eat for two days.\nThat old scratching board of Mio is still under the desk! Actually, it was originally a gemstone pillow they gave him when he was little; after Lazvar fell asleep, Mio would curl up next to his head. Later, the pillow became Mio's scratching board, and so Lazvar wrapped it in a brand-new blanket for them to use.\nOf course, there's also this teasing stick behind the door, which was originally a retractable rod gifted by Woof. It used to have a clockwork fowlbeast attached to it. Mio liked to carry this rod in her mouth, and they would chase each other around the house...\nOther than those things, there's only this pile of gemstones sitting here, their beauty now meaningless to him.\nLazvar takes out a broken clockwork fowlbeast—a prop Mio once used countless times at his bedside to perform their trick of 'swallowing a toy and throwing it up whole again', just to make him laugh. The badly-scratched clockwork fowlbeast now lies quietly in his palm, though. It seems Mio has grown out of these kinds of tricks too.\nLazvar clears the carbon box of exquisite gemstones and refills it with his few cherished memories. After some tugging and bumping, everything falls back into silence.\n'Stop watching. We should leave too.'\nA voice softly rings from a dark corner of the room once Lazvar seems to have gone far enough away.","name":"Traces From the Past","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"31074","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31014","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30094","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_4141_marcil":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Marcille","profession":"Caster","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30021","count":5},{"id":"30051","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30032","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30042","count":4},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30103","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31043","count":5},{"id":"30083","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3251","count":5},{"id":"30062","count":5},{"id":"30052","count":4}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3253","count":4},{"id":"30155","count":4},{"id":"30094","count":2}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_marcil_1","icon":"skchr_marcil_1","name":"A Top Student's Abilities","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31044","count":4},{"id":"30103","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31054","count":4},{"id":"30104","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_marcil_2","icon":"skchr_marcil_2","name":"Summon Familiar","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30064","count":4},{"id":"31043","count":1}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31074","count":4},{"id":"31034","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"30054","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_marcil_3","icon":"skchr_marcil_3","name":"Explosion Magic","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31014","count":4},{"id":"30023","count":10}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30094","count":4},{"id":"30084","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30155","count":6},{"id":"31064","count":2}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_marcil","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"SPC","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_marcil","description":"From Marcille's reading notes...\nI sat in on some 'Originium Arts' lectures. It's what they call magic here, and there are several different schools of it—my explosion magic falls under the School of Evocation. When it was Skyfire's turn to demonstrate, the class suggested we compare the differences between our magic. Afterwards, I caught the whiff of barbecue—they shared a skewer with me and made me swear not to tell Skyfire. I think she knew anyway, because the temperature around her shot up noticeably. Not to mention, it was cold that day, to the point Mint invited me to tag-team hug Skyfire. She was wonderfully warm at first, but quickly got a little too toasty!\nFamiliar summoning falls under the School of Transmutation, which is where Originium energy is used to alter something's physical composition. The class was dying to see my familiars against Mudrock's Colossi in a tug-of-war, which we refused. However, someone mentioned a game called 'beast arenas', which aren't contests of brute strength, but a magician's wisdom and skill—now this we couldn't refuse. After eventually bringing a box into the room, we made our miniature familiar and 'rockbeast' respectively. Still, Mudrock didn't even need to lift a finger to control hers! I worked my butt off trying to win!\n......\nWhile listening to them chat after class, I discovered that Yan's Chief of Lungmen is reputedly extremely handsome, and his wife is the princess of a neighboring country. Not only does she ride motorbikes, but she also has a personal ninja maid! With love blossoming amidst the intricacies of politics, they must have faced countless challenges to be together. The family head even dispatched a ninja to capture the princess. The sight of the chief and the princess together in love moved the stoic and loyal ninja, prompting her to aid them, even if it meant sacrificing herself. On a dark and stormy night, the chief carved a bloody path with his sword to reach the captive princess's chambers. They dashed to her motorbike and screeched away from their pursuers into the night. The ninja, gravely injured while covering for them, faintly smiled as she watched them ride away and then closed her eyes... There's no doubt about it—that's exactly how it happened! And obviously, the chief and the princess went back later to save the ninja!\nI know the bookstall here has a tale of their love in stock.

'Professor, I have a personal question.'\n'Ask.' Ulpianus doesn't turn around.\n'Why do you always wear the same clothes? You've been dressed like that since the day I met you.'\n'Frankly, he's been dressing like that since he was a student.

Is there another variable influencing your choice of attire?'\n'Indeed, Secunda.' Ulpianus finally turns around.

As enrapturing as a flying fist, and they called to her the way the wild things did.\nOn a certain level, these flowers held more strength than any brave warrior. Their names and stories were some of the earliest things Kemar knew by heart: learning how the people beyond the rainforest colored the four seasons with them, interpreted their lives with them. What describes these flowers now are no longer unfamiliar words, but a ring of keys, hung on her waist, opening each of Terra's doors alongside her.\n'Look well, it's our tribe's tallest, mightiest warrior! Her footprints are left in places even our imaginations couldn't reach! And now, she's back!' Kemar parts the grass weave over the doorway, and is met headon with the eager chatter of her tribesfolk, in her native language. Eventually, she stirs; in this most familiar of rainforests, she'll never be needing any 'key'.\nThe tribe's kiddies mill around Kemar, jabbing zealously at all the names on her flashcards' flowers, pestering her to tell all her stories from beyond the forest.\n'Beyond the rainforest... it's very wide.'\nKemar recalls the most exciting moment of her own language-learning Not the first time she understood a spoken word. Not being able to fluently converse with Big Boss Blaze. It was when she realized she could finally explain to others, coherently and clearly, the things that all the flowers of her home represented.\n'...But don't let me tell you about it. You should all go see it for yourself!\n'And then face off with the people outside, and tell them... let them know how mighty we are.' Kemar flips back to the very first flashcard, pressed with a flower of the rainforest. Its power to live is unwavering, and its power to adapt is unrivalled. Rainforest, prairie, or barrens, it will bloom more avidly, more ardently than all.","name":"Meaning of Flowers","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30054","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31014","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30034","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_4151_tinman":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Tin Man","profession":"Specialist","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30011","count":10}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30023","count":3},{"id":"31063","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3281","count":4},{"id":"30052","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":4}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3283","count":3},{"id":"30054","count":7},{"id":"30013","count":18}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_tinman_1","icon":"skchr_tinman_1","name":"'Ol' Curly'","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"30043","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31054","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"31034","count":1}]]},{"id":"skchr_tinman_2","icon":"skchr_tinman_2","name":"'Big Larry'","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31034","count":3},{"id":"31023","count":1}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31014","count":3},{"id":"30054","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"31064","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_tinman","cnOnly":true,"typeName1":"ALC","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_tinman","description":"“午安，女士。我来自梅兰德基金会，您可以称呼我为锡人。接下来，我将会负责这座未来的电影之都——蓝卡坞的建设。”\n“天哪，锡人先生，您可真像从电影中走出来的人。”\n“自从电影这种娱乐风靡起来之后，这样的评价我每天都要收到至少一次。”\n“那您为什么不把这样的评价化为现实呢？我敢说，电影未来一定会是哥伦比亚最流行的娱乐。”\n“我会考虑的。不过，我有一个问题，女士。我看到你们带来了许多和蓝卡坞的起点有关的东西，但是，为什么其中会有一个金属探矿器的头部和一段在矿洞中作业的影片？”\n“这真是个好问题！您知道吗，先生，我刚入行时，也问了我的前辈同样的问题。而我的前辈告诉我，这件藏品和这段影片，对电影这种艺术的诞生有着相当重要的意义。”\n“愿闻其详。”\n“您看，接在探矿器上的摄像机不仅记录了矿洞的三维结构，还捕捉到了矿石的光泽以及周围环境的动态变化。据说，这段影像拍摄于建国时期，目的是更高效地勘察地貌，不过，究竟是谁拍摄的已经不可考了。”\n“呃......毕竟我也没法告诉别人，当时我为了省事，把这个圆盘直接装在了自己的脑袋上。”\n“您说什么？”\n“——没什么，只是一点自言自语罢了。女士，我还是没明白，这和电影有什么关系？”\n“据说，蓝卡坞的奠基人，就是在拓荒过程中偶然看到了这段影片，并由此意识到——我们的技术原来已经能够做到记录并向他人展示一段生活。于是，他转而开始学习摄影技术，而后在湖边拍出了属于自己的第一部电影。”\n“这......恐怕当事人都想不到，工作时留下的影片，居然能制造这样的契机。”\n“但是，我想，如果那个人知道自己拍摄的影像还有这样的价值，他一定是欣慰的。”\n“为什么您能这么肯定，女士？在我看来，电影和许多当下兴起的娱乐一样，只是一种无意义的消遣行为。”\n“我小时候看了人生中的第一部电影，先生，我不知道该怎么形容自己的感受，我只知道——那时起，我就下定决心要参与电影的制作。\n“它在您眼中也许只是一种消遣，但在我看来，它给许多人带去理想与希望。我想，电影是一定会凭某种契机诞生的，因为，总会有人渴望以影像的方式向他人分享自己的所见所闻，所思所想。您能说，这种想法是没有意义的吗？”\n“......哈。”\n“抱歉，我没有否定您的意思——”\n“不，女士，或许您是对的。曾经有一个农夫告诉我，用于杀人的技术同样可以用来建造安居之地，我被他说服了。但当那些高楼大厦拔地而起时，一个问题开始困扰我，这就是我所期望的未来的终点了吗？而今天的这场偶遇，您让我看到了一种新的可能性。所以——\n“如果我想成为一名演员，我该怎么做？”","name":"“颅相学”","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"31054","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31074","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31014","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_4155_talr":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Figurino","profession":"Specialist","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30031","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30033","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30083","count":3},{"id":"30063","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3281","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3283","count":3},{"id":"30014","count":10},{"id":"31033","count":13}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_talr_1","icon":"skchr_talr_1","name":"Tailor's Measure","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31014","count":3},{"id":"30063","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"30094","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30104","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_talr_2","icon":"skchr_talr_2","name":"Lockstitch","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31054","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"31034","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_talr","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"MER","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_talr","description":"The man came into the shop just as it started raining.\nHe looked about sixty. Exquisite attire, stern expression, seemingly quite the panache. His satin coat was blotched with water; as Luchino welcomed him in, he helped him remove it with deft, practiced motions. The man looked him over, stared for a few blank seconds, then quickly made his way into the atelier where old Umberto had been waiting.\nLuchino would never butt in on a client meeting his nonno; he went to hang the coat on the rack instead. It was a finely made coat, sumptuous material, and most importantly, had a polished black portable crossbow in one of its inside pockets. <i>What a big shot this guy must be,</i> Luchino thought to himself.\nBefore long, an argument arose from the atelier. Fragments of speech stole their way through the door's cracks, and slipped into Luchino's ears.\n'...Luca's stuff... it ends here...'\n'...you're the one... did it... how could you...'\n'...Masina... only girl...'\n<i>Were those my mamma and papà's names?</i> Unable to help his curiosity, Luchino stuck his ear to the atelier wall, but all he caught was the sound of things falling to the floor, and the yelling of that man. '...MY flesh and blood too!'\nThe atelier door burst open, and there the man stood like a wall between him and his nonno. He opened his clenched hand, revealing a silver thumb ring in his palm.\n'This was Luca's thumb ring. It's time you took it.' The man offered it to him, the look in his eyes and tone of his words brimming with expectation.\nPast the man's shoulder, Luchino saw the once-orderly atelier in a state of disarray, fabric bolts and tape measures strewn across the floor, and Umberto shrinking away inside. Luchino had never seen his nonno quite so... weary. He was about to take the ring, but at this moment red-hot rage supplanted all his curiosity. Luchino pushed the man's hand aside, the thumb ring falling onto the rug.\n'Who are you? Nonno and I don't accept rude clients.'\nThe man's expectation promptly vanished, and his expression twisted with anger, his eyes shining green. Luchino realized—he and this man had the same eyes.\n'You are not welcome at De Montano.' Summoning all his courage, Luchino stood up straight, and repeated himself. 'Please leave.'\nThe order cut straight through the air. Luchino shocked even himself to see his words put out the fury in the man's brow. He sensed a hint of discouragement in the corners of the stranger's familiar eyes, but quickly it was covered back up beneath his solemn mask.\n'...As you wish, tailor boy. Arrivederci.' The man put his waterlogged coat back on, then took one final look at Luchino. Then, he exited the shop door and vanished into the rainy black of night.\n'Nonno, who <i>was</i> that man?'\n'A father who'd kill his own daughter.

Zumama crashed to the floor, but showed no hurry to get back up.\n'Old Man Zuluzhak said those things were nomadic cities. What's a nomadic city?' Zumama asked as she stared up at the blue sky, giving her friend the same question that had been bothering her for three whole days. She'd never been this hung up before. Even the mushrooms she'd never seen before growing on trees only lingered on her mind for a day and a half.\nGavial gave an answer she considered incredibly wise, a saying she'd heard from Old Man Zuluzhak. 'It is why it is, and that's why it is.' Then she started pumping her arms. 'You rested enough, Zumama? Let's keep going!'\nZumama suddenly felt a little listless. She got up, and walked off to where the nomadic city had sailed past. Its outline was still faintly visible, but her eyes could see far further than her feet could take her. How could a child's gait ever catch up to a sailing machine? Sunset came, and she felt the distance between her and the nomadic city hadn't narrowed one bit.\nShe felt somewhat dejected, and gloomily sat on the ground, but bumped against something as she did. From underneath her, she pulled out a strange metallic ring. Zumama had once witnessed the most experienced boy of the tribe show off roughly the same thing. What was it called, again? A short name... a 'nud'? Maybe a 'nup'?\nZumama put it in her pocket. It was likely the thing hadn't even come off the nomadic city—it was just some careless traveler's dropped belonging—but all the same, Zumama loved it, very much.\nShe began to collect these abandoned and scrapped metal parts, putting them together with no principle whatsoever. At first, she bound them with thread, then stuck them together with glue, until she eventually learned from a passing caravan what welding was.\nFinally, one day, this strange little contraption was born from Zumama's hands. Gavial and Tomimi's verdict was 'ugly', but still, she loved it, very much.\nShe clasped it in her hands, and came to where she once saw that nomadic city. It had long since vanished, but Zumama always had a feeling she could sense the tremors from it as it sailed.\nSuddenly, a strange Liberi showed up beside her, and asked, 'What's on your mind there, young lady?'\nShe tightly gripped the tiny, ugly little thing in her hands, so hard her fingers hurt.\n'I want to make it move.'","name":"'The Little Ugly Thing'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30115","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_004_zumama","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"RA","type":"A","icon":"uniequip_004_zumama","description":"In light of special permissions granted, the Field Operations Department has hence passed the following resolution with respect to Eunectes:\nWhere the entailing mission would fall under Reclamation Algorithm scope, this operator shall be pursuant to tactics of a reinforced nature in meeting the enemy.\nIn witness whereof,\nThis badge is hereby conferred upon the above named.\n'It's simple.

Continuing to bang on about it all was just further a disgrace to the dead, doing nothing to help the reality. In circumstances like these, one could hardly believe the term 'bereavement pay' ever existed. No one had a snowball's hope of getting anything meaningful out of those lackadaisical officials, at least not for now.\nSo in the end, all the protests earned was a promise—verbal, of course—that they'd end the conflict ASAP and return everyone to work sooner than ASAP, if only every single factory would just shut up and stay that way from now on until the steam engines turn again.\n'Believe in Victoria, and after that, go back inside.'\nNot unexpected, the remaining workers agreed. Still more behind her than were dead, luckily. Catherine was just the one who stepped up precisely when people were hoping for someone with a backbone. She led the lot back into the safety bounds, and wrapped the whole affair up on the spot.\nThe funeral was over just as fast as those negotiations. The way back from church to the workers' residences wasn't any longer than it used to be. Catherine hiked up to the first floor, and just like always, just like that, pulled the door open and went in. Harvey never locked the door. All the workers on the assembly line were brothers and sisters to one another; everyone visited each other whenever they liked. Thick as thieves on the clock, and off it too.\nBut now, Catherine stands as straight as ever in her sitting room. She looks about it. It's all the deathly same; there's still half a jumper sitting on the tea table next to the window. That's Lindy's knitting, at least before Lindy went to the hospital. Then Catherine took over and promptly snapped one needle while not watching what she was doing. She couldn't be arsed to replace it, so she pilfered the thinnest screwdriver out of her toolbox and used that instead. That is why the last two rows have every stitch unworked, leaving only a long succession of yawning holes.\nLet's finish that first, Catherine mutters to herself as she picks up the jumper, catches sight of what was underneath it, and then freezes. Only a worker could recognize it for what it is at a glance: a scale miniature of a steam engine, built bloody well for being cobbled together from resmelted scrap. Could only be Harvey's work.\n<i>Right. He always was brilliant at this sort of thing,</i> it hits Catherine. It's obviously just a random thingamajig built by someone with spare time to kill. Nothing valuable about it. No need to treat it like a part of him that's still here, clutching it, weeping long, bitter sobs over him.

She puts her hand in and fishes out a scrap of saltfin leather with writing scrawled on it: 'Boss, we plan to blow up the maximum security cell block with saltfin poop explosives. We'll rescue you while causing maximum chaos to scare the hell out of these people. That's how we'll keep them under our thumbs and make a fortune!' She nods her head in satisfaction, listening to the guard hum a tune as she waits for tomorrow's jailbreak.\nWait. Something's not right here! Pascuala's eyes widen as she looks at the drafty walls of her cell and the frail old guard with his back turned, humming his tune. This isn't a maximum security cell! She looks out the window. Her crew has already finished planting the explosives, and their shadows are retreating in the moonlight.\nPascuala slams down her soup bowl, 'Hey! You locked me up in the frigging wrong cell!'\nThe old guard straightens up, shakily, 'What? There's a fire in your cell?'\n'No! You put me in the wrong cell! I committed a capital offense. I should be in the supermax.\n'Huh? Soup? I just gave you your soup. No need to worry, child. This here's the county jail. I'm sure someone will bail you out tomorrow.'\n'No! I'm going to the gallows tomorrow! Look! My wanted posters are all over the walls. I should be in maximum security!'\nThe old guard squints at the wanted poster. 'No. I'm afraid you're mistaken. This looks nothing like you. She's a fearsome demon, and you're just a frightened little girl.'\n'Finshit!' Pascuala jumps three feet in the air. 'I robbed the mayor's house, kidnapped his precious pet musbeast, drained his wine cellar, sold off all his jewels, and threw a wild party in his mansion. The old geezer got so mad he passed out for three whole days! I deserve to be in maximum security!'\n'Oh—' The old guard gives her a knowing glance. 'I get it now.'\nPascuala's face glows with joy. Finally, they would transfer her to the right prison cell. Then, tomorrow, when the explosives go off, she would shock the whole town into submission! She would make her fortune with this, and even become the town mayor just for the heck of it!\nThe old guard pats her on the forehead. 'You poor girl. You must be delirious from your fever. We've got to get you to the medical office, straightaway.'\nHe rushes her off to see his good friend, the town doctor. 'You poor girl,' the doctor murmurs. 'You've been wrongly arrested and developed a fever from the shock.' He gives her medication to stop the fever, combined with a sedative. He then places her in a warm bed with heart-print sheets. By the time Pascuala drifts off to sleep, she is surrounded by plush toys, with a lollipop in her mouth.\nThe next day, Pascuala's crew, armed to the teeth with explosives, stand in grim silence around the hospital bed. The doctor places the girl in their arms. He looks them over and yells, 'You must be her family! The girl is so sick! Why didn't you bring her here earlier?!' The crew stares at their 'fearsome' leader, bundled up like a flower bouquet. A collective horrified scream rings through the room. In a panic, they dump Pascuala back onto the bed, turn tail, and bolt into the night, never to return.\n—And so, according to legend, the greatest bandit gang in Salt Town history crumbled overnight… at the hands of one old prison guard.","name":"Colorful Life in the Salt

head porter comes by Xingzhu's door for the third time, and for the third time, she apologizes to him. But in response, he waves his hand and says: 'No need to rush—in your own time.'\nWith the master of the Ning household gone, there was no reason for the scattered family to return to this old manor, and one after another, they moved their belongings out. They had places to be, and left without so much as a farewell, but Xingzhu still had fond memories of the place and stayed. However, that was only the beginning of the avalanche, as with no employer present, the help also tendered their resignations one by one. Now, she is the only one left in the grandiose manor.\nA moving van sits in the courtyard, and the porters consult her on each item they load. Each question brings a pang of reluctance; leaving anything behind feels like abandoning a piece of herself. But if she fills the small studio she rented with the past, how could she begin a new life there? In the end, she chooses only the most important things, and bade the head porter to wait for her at the manor gate.\nAfter the van leaves the courtyard, the silence of the mansion becomes even more unnerving. There is a chill in the air, and Xingzhu draws her clothes tight. She has never seen the manor so messy and deserted, its former treasures now nothing more than junk to stub your toe on, creaking as they are trod upon.\nShe slowly walks down the corridor to a large pot of lotuses, a creation she and the family gardener once nurtured together. In the past, whenever the Nings hosted a banquet, she loved looking for any excuse to wander the grounds instead. One time, the gardener took her all over the compound, and in the kitchen, they found an exceedingly suitable pot. 'One day, when there's no one left at your side, you'll still have this pot of lotuses,' said the gardener. For countless afternoons, she would sit by the pot as happy as can be, watching the little fins dart about under the lotus leaves. The gardener has gone back to his hometown to look after his granddaughter, and took the fins with him. Only the lotuses are left, and she is at a loss as to where they belong.\nShe continues onwards, wanting to see the rock garden shaped like a fowlbeast. In her youth, the oddly-shaped rock often found its way into her dreams, always turning into a true blue fowlbeast that took her to the warm place her parents lived. It is only now that she notices the rockery had collapsed, nothing more than a pile of rubble.\nShe continues onwards: to the old persimmon tree in the garden, the towering bookshelf in the study... So much to leave behind.\n......\n'Excuse me.'\n'Is there something else you wish to take, Miss Ning Yin?'\n'Yes... this key.'\nThe ancient key lies in Xingzhu's palm, the grain on its handle worn away after decades of use.\n'Even if you keep it...' The head porter hesitates and looks at her expression for a moment, before finally changing his tone: 'Very well. Nothing wrong with that.'\nAnd so, the old key hangs upon her keychain once more, despite having no use anymore. It jangles alongside the key to her new studio, echoing a lonely melody of the old days that are no more.","name":"Farewell to the Old Days","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"31034","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30054","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31064","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_4173_nowell":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Nowell","profession":"Medic","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30031","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30053","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30033","count":3},{"id":"30013","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3261","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":7},{"id":"30042","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3263","count":3},{"id":"31054","count":8},{"id":"31083","count":10}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_nowell_1","icon":"skchr_nowell_1","name":"Ceaseless Steps","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"31043","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31074","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"31034","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_nowell_2","icon":"skchr_nowell_2","name":"Unending Life","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"30023","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"31034","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"31064","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_nowell","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"WAH","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_002_nowell","description":"[Visitor Record]\nVisitor: Georgia Miltner\nReason for visit: Visiting family\nVisiting: Nowell\nDepartment: Medical\nRelation: Next of kin\n\n(Miscellaneous noises in room)\nYou came to little Connie's baby shower a few years ago, right?

He was always setting out, then coming back empty-handed. All my memories of him are just his back, coming and going out of the door at the end of the hall. I grew up, Dad got old, and on his sickbed, I vowed to both him and Grandma that I would find you.\n...What if you got the wrong man again?\nWell, I'm not so sure my kids would want to take over once my legs give out, but I'll tell them the same stories Grandma told me, and let them make their own choice. But I didn't get the wrong man, did I?\nYou're just like Madeline.\n*sigh* You mean my face? Dad said so too, but it's my granddaughter who's a spitting image of her. You don't know what name Grandma Madeline chose for her, do you?\nAnd what name would that be?\nNowell. She's called Nowell. A Gaulish name... and yours, too. Apparently, while tidying up some letters, she found one where you said it was a girl's name in Gaul, so Great-Grandma started calling you it as a joke in the reply—\n(Hurried breathing)\n(Sound of hands rubbing together)\nA-Are you alright, Mister Nowell?\nNo... No, I've... I've got nothing to do with those letters...\nI brought them along. Here. There's a family photo too, along with a letter Dad wrote to you before he passed. I figured you'd want to see.\nI...\nYou've never stopped caring, have you?","name":"To

she saw how the buildings thrust through the clouds and towered in the skies, what filled the mind of the Zalak girl, not yet Flametail Knight, was the loftiest red pine back home.\nAnd they hit her heart—a flash of longing, a flash of depression—as she recalled that final swathe of Pinus Sylvestris still standing, only to be razed in a sudden Catastrophe.\nSona had never actually returned to that forest since.\nPerhaps that pine was lucky enough to survive the disaster? And maybe, some time next year, the pinecones that fell intact would find a completely new life in the ash-blanketed earth... just as she did.\nShe had to live on, in the stead of her friends and family who lost their lives to Catastrophe. She had to plant roots and bud in the soil they named Kazimierz. Such notions kept her driven to the present day.\nBut before she knew it, Sona was shaking her head free of them all. They skipped too many steps—they would only trap her in more regrettable circumstances. She couldn't go on like this. She had to learn to be optimistic. Shape up her act, and perhaps the merchants would give her an out, and employ this little Infected girl to do what handiwork she could.\nSoon after, she learned from newspapers and television that Infected, too, could be knights. She was going to find a way in. Still, she wanted to become one just so she could make a living. With no chivalric spirit of old turned life lesson, and no grand visions or hopes, Sona clenched her fist tight.\nBut the next thing she knew, she was being forced to raise it against fellow Infected who deserved it just as little.\nSona wasn't strong, but she was nimble. She stood out amongst the Infected for it, and was selected by the bankroller of an underground power and sent into the 'cleaning qualifiers.' No weapon in hand, danger surrounding her, and a single fist planted in her foe's face. And they toppled, and Sona won the right to survive another day—but she wasn't happy. She wasn't strong. Taking her opponent down in one blow... it could only be because they were starving, because the evening before, their backer 'tipped' a few knights some bonds to get into a brawl with them.\nSona wasn't happy. She wasn't strong.\nSome fawned, telling her if she just dressed up a little, she'd be so cute, so lovely and sweet. Some gushed, telling her if she just went through some proper training, she'd be a terror of the racetrack.\nUntil one voice told her: 'You've got a tail like a blazing fire.' It caught her off guard.\nThere was nothing in particular beneath that statement, and it was no more than an ordinary spectator, reveling in the violence, who yelled it.\nBut it was the first time Sona had ever choked with emotion after a match.\nYes. She'd just realized it. She ought to be like a blazing fire.","name":"The Origins of Pinus Sylvestris","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30145","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30135","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_flamtl","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"SOL","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_003_flamtl","description":"Sona keeps complaining she's old, her body isn't light anymore.

do people like to drink?\nWhen Rafaela first began her bartending job, the question floated to her mind from time to time.\nShe can always ask her papá when she has a question. But this is a work thing—Papá usually barely talks to her about his work, so likewise, she'd better not ask him about hers.\nAnd she doesn't want to ask her hermano about it.\nEspecially not her hermano.\nSo she'll ask a customer! People are always coming and going in Dossoles, but in just a short time, Rafaela's learned to recognize a lot of regulars, and they all like to talk to her.\nAccording to the person dancing wildly to the jota while calling her 'Rafa' and 'chica' at the top of their lungs, you drink for the color, the mouthfeel, the taste, and for a moment of joy.\nBut according to the person calling her 'Señorita Silva' while leaning on the bar counter, sluggishly lifting a hand as they sing fado, you drink just to forget and be free from your worries for a while.\n'Thanks for asking,' they add more often than not.\nRafaela isn't sure if she comprehended all these answers, but she makes sure to remember every one. It's how it should be, she thinks.\nTimes change.\nAs the landship sails, there's a regular thrumming all throughout the hold. Rafaela hasn't gotten used to this noise yet—after all, it's nothing like fowlbeast chirps or beating waves—but she doesn't react badly to it at all.\nShe's asked another operator before, and now she knows this is how it should be on the ship.\nIn the landship, music is more varied too, with lots she's never heard before.\nEven so, the person who dances wildly while calling her 'Rafa' and 'chica' at the top of their lungs is still there. When she meets this kind of person, she does as they request, and squeezes some of the sweetest fruit juice into their drinks, adding some of the most bracing syrup. But at the same time, she secretly dilutes these flavors until they make for the coolest, most reinvigorating flavors. She gives whoever's drinking it a moment of joy, and all the wake-up they need to bask in that joy.\nAnd there's still the person who calls her 'Señorita Silva' and 'Miss La Pluma' while leaning on the bar counter, sluggishly lifting a hand. When she meets this kind of person, she does as they quietly ask her, and pulls the strongest, most biting bottles from the racks to pour into their glass. But at the same time, she doesn't forget to mix in a little of the finest pedigree, sourced locally from Logroño. She watches them down a glass of bitter drink, but knows the taste left behind won't be totally astringent.\n'Thank you,' they say in approval more often than not. Sometimes she nods, but feels strange about it, so other times she just doesn't nod at all.\nOf course, this method of mixology isn't entirely described in the Dossoles Guide to Cocktails, but she makes a note of it in there herself.\nAnd she's already given the book away to someone who deserves it. She may not have it anymore, but she's learned it by heart.\nRafaela feels that this way is good.\nThis is how it should be.","name":"Aqua Blue Dawn","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31034","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"31044","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_422_aurora":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Aurora","profession":"Defender","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30011","count":10}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"31013","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31023","count":3},{"id":"30083","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3231","count":4},{"id":"30062","count":3},{"id":"30052","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3233","count":3},{"id":"30074","count":9},{"id":"30013","count":19}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_aurora_1","icon":"skchr_aurora_1","name":"Homeland Protector","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"31053","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_aurora_2","icon":"skchr_aurora_2","name":"Artificial Snowfall","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30073","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"31024","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30104","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_aurora","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"HES","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_aurora","description":"Maggy, I got your pictures, thank you. The aurora's so pretty, so... stunning. Sorry I can't find better words. I saw the other material you sent back from Rhodes Island too. That little yellow flower! I never knew flowers that pretty could grow in the extreme north, all the way in the ice deserts! It's unbelievable, really.\nYou suggested I should 'join the next exploration project as a supporting surveyor,' right? I've given serious thought to it. Not whether to go or not—I still have to stay on the landship at this stage so I can get Oripathy treatment. It's what help I would be if I did go. Mayer's said how under extreme cold conditions, your Soaring Dragon drones get their stability affected. I minored in research filming while I was studying at Ironforge Polytechnic, so I tried installing a set of production lenses on my shield, so it could handle photography and data storage roles at certain temperatures. I should be able to take my shield through more special terrain, compared to using drones, and use it for fundamental defense work. It can sort out the issue of stability, too.\n......\nMaggy, I admire you, with all my heart. While everyone only has the barest imagining of what such faraway places are like, you've gone deep into them, gotten a taste of all this fascinating scenery, felt the pulse of life. I once went with a survey group into the northern icefields and saw the aurora, and that was when I learned a really important lesson in life: not every place has snowy peaks like Kjerag, and protection like Kjeragandr's, but every place has its own beauty you can't explain with common sense. The Black Flow forests, the Ringed Plains with mountains all around... all these extreme landscapes have nothing to do with the supernatural, really. They're part of Terra in themselves. I can't help but wonder, just how—shallow and narrow everything we know and hear and think and believe about this great land is.\nI want to see the aurora again more than anything else. I want to go and see the ice deserts. Not so I can prove anything—just because, well, 'I want to go and see.' Master SilverAsh is right. If we want to protect Kjerag, then we have to know just what kind of world it is we live in.\nWe can only better defend the homeland behind us if we're brave enough to explore onward. And besides, I have this sort of feeling, like the ice deserts, the poles, all these places full of hidden secrets far away already have a lot of eyes watching them... \nSo once I'm ready, Maggy, you can be sure I'll submit my application to the Doctor.\n......\nI eat... a little bigger, and I sleep more as well, but you don't need to worry, I promise.

He'd already made the kid's come true.\nOnce, Maria was viewing her ancestor's portraits by Margaret and Auntie Zofia's sides, listening to them tell legends of Kazimierzian knights of old. She lifted her head and asked her sister: 'Is the armor they wear the same as yours?'\nMargaret smiled and shook her head.\nThen Maria asked: 'What about the sword?'\nUnable to hold back a laugh, Zofia decided they'd pay a visit to Kowal's knight workshop while the weather was still good.\nThat afternoon, Maria saw Master Kowal hard at work in his shop. He was always a friend to his friends, and on occasion boisterous too.\n'If a knight's honor really be measured in a crown, then that crown's going to be made by the Craftsman's Guild,' Kowal laughed, as he picked Maria up.\nMaria didn't mind the smell of iron at all. She watched the delighted expressions flit across her sister and aunt's faces as they looked over the weapon, and her eyes shone brilliantly.\nLuckier still, she just so happened to be deft at the very thing she was interested in, which raised her spirits.\n'She's a jack-of-all-trades, I tell you,' Kowal said, wiping the foam from his mouth. 'Say, remember when we were holding that lone city out on the plains? Remember all that work the old one-eyed boy from the blacksmith's got up to, and we thought he was just some nobody? If it weren't for him, we'd have caved before reinforcements arrived!'\n'Of course I remember! How could I forget!' The old knight's face was aglow at the mention of tales of the past, and even his own drunkenness slipped his mind. 'But what're you saying? Maria could match that, no contest!'\nKowal would normally have fired a retort at his old friend out of habit, but as that stretch of the past washed over him, and he remembered the brothers-in-arms they'd lost, he fell quiet. His silence said enough though, and V took a swig of his drink before lowering his voice. 'What d'you think of her, that Maria girl?'\n'Me?' Kowal came back to his senses, went briefly blank, then let out a huge grin. 'If Maria'd been around back then, holding the city would've been nothing. Could've even counterattacked! And done it damn well.'\nV said nothing. He simply returned his own grin.\nFor the banished Margaret had come to mind.\nMaria had cried for days and nights, even wailing about how she'd go find her sister herself. It was Zofia who soothed her to sleep, and kept her company at home.\nKowal loathed himself for doing an awful job of protecting the Nearl family, and was ashamed of what old man Kirill might've thought.

Maria can tell.\nAn unfamiliar host is straightening out their formal attire, ice-cold light shrouding the entire venue, but the night sky is a million miles away, and the superfluous bustle envelops her.\nShe turns her head, only to see expressionless campaign knights. Their silver armor appears dazzling—they nod to send her their regards. Some elderly people step up, reading out indistinct sentences. She sees the Grand Knight Russell, a hair older than everyone else, the hero in her twilight, under her ceremonial guard's escort, approaching her bearing a shield.\nMaria recognizes this shield. Engraved with the crest of the Nearls, wrapped in the banner of the Nearls, it could not be any more familiar to her. Maria knows what this signifies, and she feels a sense of bewilderment. Her uncle didn't want her becoming the Knight Primus, and her sister didn't want to acknowledge the modern knight institution. So what should she do?\nOr... what does she want to do?\nMaria hurriedly looks around. Her sister's not there. Her auntie isn't there. Uncle Młynar, V, Master Kowal, Marcin, none of them are there. She wants to run, but rationality lashes her to the spot. This is a major occasion. She can't shrink away, even if this isn't how she wanted it.\nNerves and unease momentarily catapult Maria into reminiscence. It's a workshop breathing with sizzling heat, and she's forging a brand new sword for her sister Margaret. V and Master Kowal are bickering as ever—Zofia lovingly wipes her forehead to take off the sweat, and tidies up her disheveled hair. Młynar is in the shade of a tree not far away, silently watching over it all, and on the other side of the street, long since lost to her childhood memories, are her father, mother, and the one who'd left only the shadow of a lance behind at the fringes of her hopes, old Grandpa Nearl...\n'From this day forth, you are Knight Primus of the Nearl family.'\nMaria accepts the shield, and its solitary weight leaves her lost at sea. She feels as if she's still in that vision. She's still poring over blueprints, operating the furnace. She doesn't want to forge mail to amuse the people, nor lances to slaughter the innocent.\nShe wants to forge an 'ideal.' An 'ideal' to protect the ones she loves, to become a hero's strength, to brace herself upright, never to dread confusion and solitude.\nThe clanging of steel on steel still rings in her ears. Engulfing the cheers, engulfing the glory.\n'Maria.' A familiar voice softly calls to her.\nShe lifts her head, and at this moment the clamorous arena holds not a soul in sight.","name":"'Knight Primus'","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30115","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_426_billro":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Carnelian","profession":"Caster","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30011","count":6},{"id":"30061","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30022","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30032","count":4},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30053","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30063","count":3},{"id":"31013","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3251","count":5},{"id":"30062","count":5},{"id":"30032","count":5}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3253","count":4},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"30104","count":7}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_billro_1","icon":"skchr_billro_1","name":"Sandstorm Guardian","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30084","count":4},{"id":"30063","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30094","count":9}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30125","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_billro_2","icon":"skchr_billro_2","name":"Sand Fetters","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31034","count":4},{"id":"31013","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31014","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":10}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30074","count":7}]]},{"id":"skchr_billro_3","icon":"skchr_billro_3","name":"Mark of Gluttony","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30104","count":4},{"id":"30083","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30044","count":4},{"id":"31024","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"30104","count":5}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_billro","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"PLX","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_billro","description":"Having hastily finished his dinner, Hohenlohe has just about stepped into his villa's quarters for the night when Carnelian appears behind him without warning.\n'What are you doing here so late?'\n'You had worries, and I've just seen to them.

Having left his Spire for the moment so as to smooth out tomorrow's parade, the Count feels the air faintly nip at him.\n'Hold on, what made you—no, let me restate.

I'm certainly not disposed to learn an instrument for you.'\n'I don't care! I demand you learn! I demand it!'\nThe Count glares at his unrepentant attendant with all the temper of a small child, ultimately not so furious as to pounce at anything—he simply slams the door as he leaves.\n\nBut the moment the door latches shut, Carnelian places a firm grip on the dagger at her waist.\n'Alright, you behind the curtain. Come out.\n'An assassin sent by the diet, I presume? And you really think that once the Count is dead and his cousin succeeds the title in all his ambition, he'll grant the Stadtrat autonomy?\n'No. Forget that. Here's a different question. Would you prefera sophisticated death, or one more to-the-point?\n'...Well, if you won't say anything, can I take that as the dealer's choice?'\nThe assassin barely has time to twitch before the curtain becomes a pair of lips, the bookshelves jaws, and the candles incisors. One massive chomp on their windowside prey is followed by chewing, then a swallow, and finally a mess all over the floor.\n\n'It's over now. Won't you come in?'\nThe Count pokes his head through the door to confirm that all danger has passed, then musters all his courage before entering.\n'Very swift to react, and on-point with the improvisation as well. Quite well done.'\n'I don't need you complimenting me.'\nThe two of them stare at the villa bedroom, a scene of chaos and scraps and fresh blood, neither breaking the silence.\nIt isn't the first unsuccessful assassination attempt, but all previous ones have taken place at Count Hohenlohe's Spire, which is hardly dilapidated enough to let would-be murderers as far as the sleeping quarters.\nAfter a spell, the Count breaks the tension.\n'Carnelian.'\n'What?

In this, you can see the significance of the local accent to Sargonians. However, one time, Beeswax made a sudden appearance in a Leithanian restaurant where she seated herself right across the table from her sister, and as Carnelian's hand slowly fell from her in-ear comms terminal, her expression flickered with rare alarm.\n'S... Surprise? Heheh...'\nIn a snap, Carnelian shut off her receiver.\nIt wasn't as if Beeswax forgot her sister's advice to keep away from Leithanien. Abashed, she explained that she was just passing through. A paper-thin lie; Carnelian could already imagine which Rhodes Island operator had needlessly put her up to the task.\nShe wasn't especially dismayed, of course. She positively coddled Ankhesena, indulging every anecdote from her journey, their table the picture of love and peace. Meanwhile, in her ear, a very different picture was being painted.\n'Boss! Do you copy! The target's about to enter the Arts Circle focus!'\n'She was laying low, right?! Did shit go down at the restaurant?!'\n'Sis, what's that buzzing coming from your ear?'\n'Oh, it's just music. The Leithanians aren't half bad at it. You'd like it.'\n'Boss! Are you there?!'\nCarnelian sighed and got up. 'It's a little noisy, though. Give me a moment to go and adjust it.'\nThe 'music' her sister mentioned caused Beeswax some turmoil. It'd been years since they last met, during which this strange country had clearly changed her sister—for someone accustomed to the most beautiful melodies, would she really like whatever <i>that</i> was? Beeswax clutched her bundle tight, too shy to open it.\nCarnelian returned, astonishingly quickly. She took off her terminal, finally able to show a relieved smile.\n'What about your music, Sis?'\n'It's over. I have more important things still waiting for me to sample—'\nA word from home, to signify an emotion. Fit to describe the soothing, settling look in Carnelian's eyes, as if by some Originium Arts... It blew Beeswax's worries away. At last, she pulled the item of the hour out of her bag—a plain Sargonian sistrum, distinctly out of place in Leithanien.\n'Oh! And I thought you'd lost that forever ago! That's the only instrument I can even play.'\nJingle, jangle. The warm, rustic sound of home.\n'That takes me back. It's what I always soothed you with when you were little.

Just sometimes... when you're too busy to reply, and you don't have time to visit home, just listen to it...'\nCarnelian relented, her gaze turning soft. <i>Alright, I'll remember to write back, and I'll make my way home again as soon as I can,</i> she wanted to say. But she didn't make that promise—it's one she had no idea when she'd be able to keep, if ever. Instead, she picked up the sistrum and gave it a light shake.\nHow very, very curious. Here, in a Leithanian restaurant, she could almost hear the rustling of the leaves on Sargon's trees... She and Ankhesena always liked to call it the forest playing to them.

This certainly won't do any favors for Miss Valentine's future career! \nAnd in addition to that, she's going to need to personally look over her custom equipment, and if she's not here... \nHuh? Wait, what's that sound? \nHmm... Is that... somebody playing the flute? \n\nThe soft melody of the flute was gently carried along the wind, far, far away. \nEver higher, ever further away. \nThe wind continued to blow, to the place I promised to return to. \nPlease, take this tune back with you. \nPlease tell everyone. \nThat Justyna has finally become a knight. \nBut don't tell anyone. \nThat Justyna sorely misses her home. \n\n......\n......My goodness, how long have I been here?! \nI shouldn't be spacing out like that!

I've almost filled up the wastebasket with scrapped drafts at this point. In the end, I think that cliche is the only thing I can really write.\n\nThis is the first time in my life I'm writing a letter to a hero of mine. You said during an interview that you read every single letter from your supporters, and I know you wouldn't lie!\nFirst, I want to congratulate you on getting the title 'Fartooth,' it's so incredibly cool! I was there for your match with Feather Knight, the sight of you winning without any backup at all touched all of us there! It's only right you were #1 in the season!\nEver since I first saw a match of yours three years ago, I got really into you as a knight. You might not remember, but I was sat in the front row of the grandstand, and the knight who was against you slipped up with a move and almost hurt the audience, but then you blocked it even though you were injured. Among the people you saved, the ones behind you, were me and my family.\nEver since then, you've been an inspirational figure for me. You're a true knight, Ms. Justyna, I'm surer of that than anything. I was still a student then, and if I studied good enough and my grades got better, my family would reward me by taking me to see your matches. I could say you were the one who gave me the drive to keep heading forwards.\n\nI want to become a glorious knight like you so much! Knights would never point their arrowheads at the defenseless, and I don't believe you'd ever use violence against any Knightclub's fans!\nThe 'Fartooth' Knight Justyna I know doesn't concede even when she's hurt, and never talks down to other knights even in the arena. I, along with your other supporters, don't believe any of that slander against you, so please don't take those irresponsible newspaper reports to heart! We're all looking forward to you returning as soon as you can!\nAlso, when I heard you say you wanted to start your own Knightclub, I was over the moons! You always ran solo in the past, and sometimes you looked sort of lonely, so it made me and a lot of other fans really worried... In the end, whether you start your own Knightclub, join another one, or stay active as an independent knight, we'll always support you as long as it's your decision, Ms. Justyna!\nWe hope everything goes well for you!\n\nYour faithful supporter","name":"Fan Letters","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30145","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30135","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_431_ashlok":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Ashlock","profession":"Defender","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30021","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30103","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31033","count":3},{"id":"31043","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3231","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":7},{"id":"30062","count":2}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3233","count":3},{"id":"31014","count":8},{"id":"31053","count":13}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skcom_atk_up[3]","icon":"skcom_atk_up[3]","name":"ATK Up γ","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31034","count":3},{"id":"31013","count":1}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30064","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"31044","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_ashlok_2","icon":"skchr_ashlok_2","name":"Focused Bombardment","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31054","count":3},{"id":"30063","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"30054","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"31054","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_ashlok","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"FOR","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_ashlok","description":"As evening fell, the crowd receded from both ends of the street, revealing the snow-covered pavement. Greynuty hesitated for a moment before finally taking a step onto it.\n'Slippery, very slippery, you could fall.' That was the first thought that popped into her head.\nImmediately thereafter, the second thought emerged: 'It might be fun, if I don't fall.'\nThrough her sunglasses, Greynuty cautiously surveyed her surroundings. The street was long, offering considerable distance for a run-up. It was also deserted, with no one to witness her.\n'One, two, three!' Taking a few steps back, she braved the cold wind and sprinted forward, accelerating as she went, then abruptly halted, letting momentum carry her forward in a slide.\nShe then started running again, heading toward the other end of the long street. One meter, two meters, three meters... The speed of her running and sliding increased with each attempt, and her heart rate accelerated with the rhythm of her sprint, bringing a sense of weightlessness. The lightness of her body felt almost as if she were floating down a flowing river.\nThe river of time.\n'Don't be afraid, try to go faster, we'll catch you.' In a trance, amidst the whistling wind in her ears, she heard a familiar encouragement. Similar scenes awakened from dusty childhood memories. At the end of the road, a couple smiled and opened their arms to her.\nSo this time, she began to sprint with all her might, only to be brought back to reality by a stone under her foot.\nAfter plunging headfirst into a snowdrift by the roadside, she didn't rush to get up, but instead held her face in her hands. Unsure whether she'd grazed her eyebrow or cheek, she felt a dampness around her eyes.\n'Need a hand getting up, Ashley?' A figure blocked the setting sun, reaching out to her.\n'How did you end up here?' She placed her hand in hers.\nShe stood up, brushed the snowflakes off herself, and picked up her sunglasses and hat that had scattered nearby.\n'You went out for some beer. But it was getting late and you didn't come back, so I was worried. Had to come out to check on you.'\n'*Cough* I'm fine.'\n'Don't lie, your eyes are really red.'\n'The sun's just too bright.'\n'The sun's down.'\n'...Thanks for helping me up.' She put her hat and sunglasses back on, covering her reddened eyes and cheeks.\n'You're welcome.'\n'Oh, actually, there's no point in you arming up like that, Ashley.'\n'Why not?'\n'That shop on the corner there has a special window.

We all muttered how it was some devil's witchcraft silently spreading about, and so we all kept our houses tightly shut. But we didn't have the heart to throw a single frail woman back into the wild in the rainstorm, so we agreed to let her in.\nThe first moment she laid eyes on Veitch, she sensed something was wrong. She was prudent as we worked through his symptoms with her, and she asked how the village at large was doing, before revealing herself to be a roving doctor.\n'This is no Originium Arts; it's an illness. The soil and wellwater is contaminated, and the children are the first to be sick; as the poisoning builds up over time, the adults will come to show symptoms too.'\nShe opened her suitcase, and mixed a medicine with practiced hands. As she did, she spoke. 'I'm sorry. All I can give myself is a temporary first aid, but the only way to cure an illness such as this is to be away from the contamination's source, and convalesce through medication in the long-term. If possible, I'd ask you to tell all the village that they should move away from here.'\n'But this is our home,' my husband said with worry. 'Even if this soil will harm us, where are we going to shelter if we leave here?'\nThe doctor said nothing more. She worked in simple silence.\n\nThe weather had cleared up the next day, and I found the doctor just as she was about to leave. On the door was stuck a wild flower, a kind that grew anywhere. In that instant, a faint memory of someone seemed to match with her in my head.\n'I remember you, doctor. I've met you before.'\n'I was still in a small town on the outer edge of a nomadic city. You'd make home visits to everyone, and you always secretly handed out fresh flowers to us children... I was behind the curtains watching, I remember seeing from there.'\n'That was decades ago by now. My mother caught Oripathy, see and we were driven out... and I've gone from a child to a married woman now, I know you wouldn't recognize me. But, well, you look about the same now, compared to all the way back then.'\nI told her how grateful I was for her, from the bottom of my heart, for she cured me of my fever when I was young, and now she'd saved my own child too. Yet the look on her face was at first blank, then became so sorrowful, as if she was close to weeping.\n'No, please... don't go on any further.

For an entire week, the cafeteria speakers played a song at the same time every morning. But when fans of the song asked around, the broadcast room staff insisted that no one had played any music or sung in there!'\n'Ah, I've been up on the scaffold each morning this week, refinishing the wall, so I must've missed it. Shucks, what a shame.'\n'Then maybe you can help us, Mina. Based on the accent and lyrics, I'm pretty sure the voice belongs to a Colombian operator! She was singing: Onward! Onward! Dig! Dig! Build! Build! Our city must keep growing!'\n'The dust falls in our eyes, as the towers rise—wait, you got me singing along! Haha!'\n'Yes, exactly! That's how it goes! Wait, your voice sounds somewhat similar... but they sang with so much more energy!'\n'If you don't belt your heart out on the worksite, the foreman'll think you're slacking. But if you ask me who else know this song...'\n'—Yes, very suspicious indeed.

It's a microphone!'\n'Oh, that old thing? It's just for fun. Look, you can see the beautiful nomadic city in the distance through the porthole; who wouldn't wanna sing before such a nice view? But my wireless speaker's broken, so no way the sound's making it downstairs.'\n'Hmm? Oh!'\nWith a sudden gasp, Click grabs the microphone. 'Ladies and gentlemen, we've solved the mystery!

In a daze, she is propped up by her grandmother, while the others take turns checking the thermometer. Soon after, the air no longer feels so stuffy, and the room returns to its usual levity.\nHer grandmother tells her she had a fever, and that she slept for several days. The aroma of oat porridge stirs her appetite, and the brightly-colored cherry tomatoes dotting the bowl are pretty enough that one could hardly look away. Nonetheless, the subtle lemon fragrance entices her to gaze out the window. She sees clothes drying and waving in the wind, while the lemon trees in the garden send her their greetings. Just like every other windy morning.\nThe girl's head clears a bit more, yet she feels like some of her memories have gotten fuzzy.\nA few days later, she apprehensively asks her grandmother for help remembering, but she only comforts her, saying they were just fever dreams.\nHer grandmother hadn't put away her bubble wand, and she never emptied her bottle of soapy water. She had merely called a big gathering to discuss the family leaving Siracusa, and what they needed to prepare for their move to Columbia.\nBut that was no fever dream.

Of how, despite being a rainless day, the streets were wet, with water slowly flowing towards the drains. Of how the mixture of reeking blood, smoke, and sweat attracted all sorts of bugs to its surface.\n...Many years later, that vivid scene still remains in her memory.

Standing at the edge of a cliff with shouts behind her, all Zoey Perris could think of was her mother's anxious eyes when she left Rhodes Island.\nAs her pursuers closed in, Zoey leapt off the cliff.

She opened the door to find Zoey standing outside, with the tattered cloak covered in dust.\nSuddenly, regret washed over her. She was the patient to be cared for, and it was her daughter who managed everything perfectly. Life wasn't about Zoey easing her burdens anymore, but about her trying to ease Zoey's.\nShe let Zoey take off the cloak, admitting she'd been overthinking. But Zoey didn't respond. Instead, she pulled her mother to sit down and began explaining the damages on the cloak—branches, gravel, finbeasts... until she reached the rip made by an arrow.\nShe saw her mother gently shake her head, more pleading than forbidding. But she continued, recounting how an infected man, almost enslaved because no one would help him, led to the slaver firing that arrow out of spite.\n'Each mission, we actually helped some people, who were just a bit luckier than Dad, who didn't vanish silently. And the damage to the cloak isn't always from weapons. This time, it was just this one arrow... I can take care of myself. Please rest assured.'\nZoey bit her lip, looking at her mother, whose face showed a mix of sorrow and pride. Finally, her mother silently patted her head, took off her cloak, and draped the previously mended one over her shoulders.\nThe sewing machine hummed as Zoey, wrapped in the carefully patched cloak,

This device uses cutting-edge smart technology to solve any issue you may run into while raising metal crabs. Racked with worry that you can't tend to your crabs while away from home? Afraid that ordinary feeders could incubate harmful bacteria that will affect your crabs? Well, worry no more! The 'All-You-Crabs-Eat' offers your crabs a nutritionally balanced diet, all pre-portioned according to the latest science!\n'Sounds good, but what's this 'cutting-edge smart technology'?'\n'Oh, I asked Mayer to help with the computer interface stuff. In return, I lent her Peacake to help her develop a biomimetic intelligent partner.'\n'I see...'\nIf you're using this device for the first time, please follow the illustrated instructions to assemble the feeder and food barrel, then use the touchscreen to complete your device's basic setup. The 'All-You-Crabs-Eat' offers three preset feeding schedules, and can support up to ten additional custom schedules. And if you can't bear to miss the wonder of even a single feeding session, order our camera now and enjoy a 20% discount!\n'A camera? Whose idea was that?'\n'I thought of it during training! The instructors stuck some tiny cameras on crabs for a while to assess their combat abilities. So I figured I'd add something similar as an upgrade for the feeder! Cute pet videos are all the rage on Columbia's intercity net, you know!'\nDue to their omnivorous nature, we suggest setting the feeder to a single daily serving, with a serving size not exceeding 10% of the weight of your metal crab. The 'All-You-Crabs-Eat' supports freeze-dried feed, and requires no pre-crushing. We recommend using it with 'Beanstalk's Fine Metal Crab Feed,' launching alongside the feeder! With fifteen natural ingredients following a carefully developed formula, your crabs will be feasting like kings! Their pincers will grow stronger!\nUsage instructions:\n1. Do not feed children with this device.\n2. Place the device on a level surface to avoid spillage.\n'P.S. While setting up your feeding schedule, please remove your metal crab from the room. Some breeds are extremely intelligent, and may learn to use the feeder.'\n'I-Is that really true?'\n'Of course. That's how Peacake did.

The fallen sycamore leaves densely covered the ground, burying the smell of fish beneath the soil. He bolted the gate of the kung fu hall from the inside, and in the dead of night, took a copper rod from the weapon rack used for emergencies, climbed the wall, and left the courtyard. \nNot long afterwards, a town near Kou-wu City found itself one sunglass-sporting fortune-teller extra. On sunny days, he would set up his stall at intersections, and on rainy days with few pedestrians, he would take his umbrella and go fishing by the river outside town. The umbrella perfectly covered him, its ribs heavy so it would not blow away. Some envied him for living such a flamboyant lifestyle - was he so attuned to Heaven's will that he could keep his head up above the ocean of mundane affairs? Others accused him of being a cheat and a fraud, questioning if he really knew his own destiny. \n'Of course. How could I not know?' He would reply with a smile. \nAn umbrella only protects one from the rain, but not against concealed weapons like arrows or darts. His umbrella torn, he has no choice but to pack his bags and find another town where he could mend his umbrella. Numerous are the days of dark wind and rain, and he gradually feels that he had nowhere to go. All he knows is that the endpoint of his life will still be at that martial arts hall. He needs not walk the path that follows afterwards, but he knows not how to traverse the path leading there. The inch of ground beneath his umbrella is hardly enough for him to settle down, for it is no solid roof. \nBut it is then that he meets a strange group of people. Later, he learns another saying from those people. If translated into mandarin Yanese, it would be 'Heaven's mandate lies in man.' \n––The above is what Operator Mr. Nothing told you personally. Rhodes Island is currently running from a small-scale Catastrophe in the making at full speed, but Mr. Nothing is lying on a chair without a worry in the world, his umbrella tied and tucked away at his side.

It has been written into story, woven into folksong, taught by parents to their children while they still burble and babble, climb to their feet with a stagger, learning all the while.\nThere is a symbol that a child of the sijdda is young no longer, has become an adult who will weather the blizzards, and it is not by means of counting years, but by whether they can enter the tundra alone, and retrieve a knot of blessings that their parents tied to a pillar of ice in the snowy fields at their birth.

The unit at its head seemed to be the key to its function, but we could find no clear theory underpinning it. During further studies, new Operators Irene and Lumen—who had visited Engineering to undergo equipment certification—coincidentally passed by, and the latter took one look at Indigo's staff and very confidently told us that he had seen something similar in the 'Eye of Iberia.' The 'Eye of Iberia' is a lighthouse... a series of lighthouses along Iberia's coastal towns, a grand project that once illuminated the whole nation, abandoned altogether after a disaster decades ago, and now a legacy of the age. Indigo's teacher was one of those very lighthouse keepers, and it was he who gave her the staff as she left home.\n'The unit at her staff's head is a standard installation in Iberia's lighthouse systems.' This much should be more or less accurate. The issue was that, based on her account, her teacher protected the Rocky Coast's lighthouse all his life, hoping it would one day shine anew. So why would he give her something so important and then allow her to leave?\nIndigo herself had this to say: 'I'm sure my teacher wanted me to gain some experience on the outside, unravel the secret of its technology, and let it come to life once again... He really was mindful!'\nMeanwhile, Irene stated: 'Will Iberia's lighthouses never shine again without those Ægir relics? Iberia's prosperity should be left up to the Iberians themselves this time.'\nIndigo and Irene's answers undoubtedly represent two different outlooks held by the modern Iberian on the nation's future, and deserve some consideration. However, once they had both left, Lumen raised an alternative, 'small-minded' conjecture, more or less that before an old man sends his granddaughter off to the city, he stuffs the only valuable they own into her suitcase and hopes she'll never come back, or that he'll have passed by the time she does... or thereabouts.\n'The elderly are like that. They like to decide everything for you while you're still clueless,' Lumen added.\nSpeculating on an old man's intentions seemed unnecessary. Besides, having ascertained the history of her Arts unit, our investigation into Indigo was complete. And, of course, it would never have affected how welcome she is at Rhodes Island. But we will note that upon learning the staff's origins, Indigo went blank for a moment. As for what thoughts she had in that instant, and what decisions she made, we have no way of knowing.","name":"Staff Maintenance Kit","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"30043","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":20000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":15},{"id":"30023","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":25000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":5},{"id":"31043","count":6},{"id":"4001","count":30000}]]}]},"char_472_pasngr":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Passenger","profession":"Caster","rarity":"TIER_6","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":5}],[{"id":"3301","count":5},{"id":"30031","count":6},{"id":"30041","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30052","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":8},{"id":"30013","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31013","count":4},{"id":"30043","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3251","count":5},{"id":"30042","count":8},{"id":"30012","count":5}]},{"maxLevel":90,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3253","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30044","count":5}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_pasngr_1","icon":"skchr_pasngr_1","name":"Touch of Static","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30074","count":4},{"id":"30053","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31034","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":8}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30115","count":6},{"id":"30104","count":6}]]},{"id":"skchr_pasngr_2","icon":"skchr_pasngr_2","name":"Focus Command","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"30084","count":4},{"id":"30063","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"30014","count":4},{"id":"30094","count":9}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30135","count":6},{"id":"31034","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_pasngr_3","icon":"skchr_pasngr_3","name":"Glorious Shards","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":8},{"id":"31034","count":4},{"id":"31013","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":12},{"id":"31014","count":4},{"id":"30014","count":10}],[{"id":"3303","count":15},{"id":"30145","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_pasngr","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"CHA","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_pasngr","description":"'Water...' \nTrudging endlessly through the sandstorm, gone a full day without water, my body has slowly begun to lose the strength to stand. \nKal'tsit hasn't a water bottle, instead coldly telling me to 'hold on for a little longer,' soon after continuing on her own brisk way ahead. \nHow long have we spent slogging through these winds?

Once, it was an arms dealer's territory. I worked under him in my first few years in this place. He was a born despot. He left several welts on my back, but I've no hate for him. It was only natural, just as it was only natural that his irate underlings slit his throat in drunkenness, before throwing him from a cliff. I placed my first gold coin in those turncoats' hands, and it was warm to the touch.\nThe northern oasis, Reefsteep's border. For a time and an age, the favored turf of the mercenaries. Soldiers were replaced batch by batch, but there was only ever one leader. My biggest customer, and the one who taught me how to taste wine. But that winter, he died. He died in front of my storehouse, his body bruised and battered. He coveted my creations, and died to my precautions. Mercenaries keep no loyalty, and thus I rewarded his subordinates at his funeral. Unfortunately, his life couldn't even buy a decent bottle of wine.\nThe southern side, where the towns sit. Messengers and merchants come and go in spades, the value they trade in circulating through the villages. The lords recognize as much, hence why Ibut's lord ameer had such a special fondness for the place. Sargon's unbearably chaotic, barbaric politics never interested me, but I needed the lord's support. The division of powers within the Reefsteep Black Market bored me so much I'm loathe to mention it, but we all had something to say when it came to the lord. I'm surprised that I held such frail relations for so long; a lord that doesn't judge by the cover, perhaps? Out of respect, I didn't personally attend the revolt. But once his family were puppets, I did show up to pay respects to that poor boy—he was akin to Elliot. Akin to me.\nThe Reefsteep Black Market's center. An old tomb lies there, an ancient pasha's grave. Every night, Isin carefully wipes his memory under the light of the stars. A long time ago, I exhausted his wealth. And by now, I've repaid him several times over, but he doesn't pay any mind. His age looms by the day, and aside from a few errant, insignificant questions, we never even speak.\nThat day, Old Isin asked me why others call me 'Sand Soldier.'\n'Sand Soldier.'\nThe meaninglessness of a grain of sand. The pathetic fate of a pawn. The term is filled with significance I abhor.\nHence why I gladly accepted it. As a price paid in advance, for the impossible trial to follow. The Reefsteep Black Market had its towns, and they were fuel ready for the fire.\nI waited for the lord ameer of Ibut to come. If I could, I would have burned even the golden sands to nothing.\nAnd in the final moment before I set the flame alight—\n—what came to mind was the afternoon a young Elliot Glover was taken to tour an institute of science, where he sees a new model of Originium engine ignite and combust, upon which a tremendous machine stirs to life.

Your dad carried the disaster-prevention pamphlets you sent back and handed them out door-to-door. The teachers at the local school read those pamphlets and even praised your writing, saying your wrist strength has greatly improved. When he told me this, I felt really happy for you, but when the night falls, I still can't help but feel a bit sad. Ning-Ning, my girl, you're far from home now. When you sit at the desk writing and studying until your fingers are all sore, you wouldn't be able to run over to me for a good massage... All I can do is remind you to rest well in my letters.

The festival is coming up next week, and not only are the kids excited about the rice dumplings and snacks, even Grandma is thrilled. When the weather is nice, she likes to do some needlework on her lounge chair, but her eyesight isn't great, so she always needs help threading the needle. One afternoon, when I got back home from work, she complained to me that she had called for you many times in the morning, but you never came. I didn't know how to explain it to her; it was both funny and a bit sad. I took the afternoon off that day and made two sachets with Grandma. Actually, I've never really sewed anything before, so my stitching came out all crooked—you'll probably recognize which one I made at first glance. Or you can tell it by its smell. I filled it with some dried acanthopanax root, the same herb we used to put under your pillow to help calm your mind. Hang the sachet by your bed and it should give off a gentle scent that might help you sleep better.\nYour dad and I agreed to cooperate on this letter and it was supposed to start with me writing and then your dad finishing it.

Everything at home is going well, and both your dad and I are doing fine at work. Whenever people talk about you, they always praise how strong and brave you are.

Not that she would with any regularity be fully awake when the clock rolls over to zero, but tonight, she needs to look at herself. She needs to choose. As other Ægir view her, she is Gladiia, daughter of key Academy of Sciences personnel, winner of all youth competitions, a family girl, a young success story. But in her mirror, Gladiia sees a carbon-based robot, an emotionless form. Her memory begins with her birth mother being infatuated with Ægir affairs and Academy policymaking, her home merely a secondary point of residence, after the Academy's lounge. She once believed her birth mother sought accomplishment from her, and so she compelled herself to relentlessly reach new heights, applying the standards of adults to her young self. But she never was able to pry any form of feedback from her birth mother—no acknowledgement, no criticism, nothing whatsoever. No, her birth mother gave all her time to Ægir, and left not one idle second of one spare minute for her daughter.\nPerhaps it was all an accident that she was raised, and this household had no reason to exist. This was the sort of conclusion Gladiia reached.\nSo, what else but to look for somewhere she can truly call 'home,' Ægir she can truly call 'family.'\nShe has decided. She will seek. She is set to do it.\nShe wants to hear for herself just what kind of case her birth mother might make in a civil court of law.\nGladiia stows away the handmirror, turns off her light, and sinks into rest.\nHer mind swims frantically with planning.\nShe is restless all night.\n......\nGladiia stands before the tremendous standing mirror of the Consul's residence, examining her negligible self in the looking glass. In just a few hours, she will depart the mansion, take to an operating table, and begin the Abyssal Hunter modification surgery. Perhaps, the moment the procedure is over, her dutiful vocation will be as a military commander and not a Technology Consul, and she will take to the battlefield, there becoming a monster with hands drenched in fresh blood. This has completely destroyed any notion of plotting her life's trajectory, and may even end her time then and there. Gladiia has never feared death, nor the giving of her life, but the sumptuous hall she sees in the mirror does make clear to her an aside—she is still teeming with regrets. Some are desires, some are responsibilities, some are promises, and becoming an Abyssal Hunter will render them all forever unfulfilled. If only the surgery could be postponed long enough, if only Ægir could publish the full scope of the plans to her as soon as possible... This is the first time she realizes that she had never had it all firmly in her grasp like she thought. She will lose, and she will never be able to regain.\nGladiia looks around the hall one more time, then returns to her study.\nIn a few hours, she will depart for the Abyssal Hunter experimentation site. Before she does, she has the mansion's smart housekeeping system store two documents.\nOne, her speech to be given upon becoming an Abyssal Hunter.\nOne, a will.\n......\nAfter Gladiia is marooned in a land not of Ægir, she has in the truest sense of the words lost it all. All she has left with her are a bloodridden lance, a still-passable outfit, and a desiccated and scorching eternity. And now, she stands before a pothole filled with fresh water, gazing upon her own reflection, washing the filth and bloodstains from her clothes.\nThe silt comes off with the water easily enough, but the clots of blood on her garments refuse to be washed off. With no option but to brush them by hand, she watches as their hardened forms attain a pellucidity, turn the shade of liquid blood, and run through the seams, dripping to a rest upon the soil. Is it her blood? The Seaborn's blood? Or her fellows' blood? She cannot differentiate. All of a sudden, Gladiia notices something, and she leans close to the hole, carefully examining her neck.\nA tiny scale.\nThough why is a mystery, Gladiia's birth mother comes to her mind in that moment. If she could, she would rather suffer her neglect again. This scale would never have found the chance to rest upon her neck.\nBut it has.\nGladiia stands up, and throws her freshwater-soaked hair behind her in one gesture.\nShe can indeed feel it. There is an embitterment, a discontent inside her. There is no need for these feelings to surface, and they do nothing to help in this present situation.\nShe has indeed lost it all, but she finds she can still afford to uphold her basic honor and dignity, which in turn means she can still move onwards with her head held high.\nShe needs no hope. She simply focuses on possibilities, feasibilities, and results.\nShe can still return to Ægir.\nShe is still alive to recover the Abyssal Hunters, scattered and lost.\nAs long as the probability is not zero, she is still bound to try.\nSo make good on it she shall.\nGladiia wipes her lance's bloodstains dry, and vanishes from the side of the 'hole.'\nSeconds later, the sonic boom jolts the water from the pool, blanketing any and all trace she was ever there.","name":"Consul's Handmirror","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30125","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30135","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30145","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]},{"id":"uniequip_003_glady","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"HOK","type":"Y","icon":"uniequip_003_glady","description":"'Technology Consul Gladiia, before we proceed with the surgery, I am authorized to ask: Would you like to keep a sample of your original genes?'\nLittle Handy nimbly extends its mechanical arm, and through its speaker comes the voice of the researcher in charge of the surgery.\nThe Consul looks up at the faces of the Ægir in the remote operation room. Many of these researchers are elites she hand-picked from the Academy of Technology—capable, experienced, and loyal to both the Ægir people and every dome under the tides. Now, these elites look back at their Consul through the mirror, made from the same material as the domes, and purse their lips. Since asking her the question, none have spoken; some even turn away from the gaze of their Consul.\nAs a Consul, social rationality is usually the only philosophical instrument Gladiia needs to analyze the behaviors of others. Born in the sea, the Ægir never display meaningless behavior, so at this moment, she is particularly curious about the silence of her fellow people. Is it reverence, fear, or sadness? Or perhaps it is guilt and relief all at once, that the person who has to sacrifice their body to merge with the Sea Born and save all of Ægir is not them?\nShe knows she will not get the answer now, and will have no need for it once the surgery is complete.\nShe remembers when the Academy of Science attempted to develop a batch of artificial organisms injected with Sea Born neuro-cells. These organisms were intended to mimic Sea Born activities in a controlled environment, aiding the Ægir in understanding those abominations. To achieve this, they had to be both loyal servants of the Ægir and establish a limited connection with the Sea Born and their clan.\nShe recalls that the project, which initially made huge progress, ended in tragedy. As cell integration reached a critical point, the organisms were quickly assimilated by the Sea Born and devoured the entire research team. The Sea Patrol had no choice but to call off the rescue and obliterate the entire research facility from the sea bed with their battleship.\nShe also remembers her mother, Horatia, being a staunch supporter of that radical project. They had even debated over it. Now, Gladiia herself is about to partake in an even more radical experiment, with several failed attempts and dead subjects before her already.\nThe first Hunter of Ægir once said that the Abyssal Hunters would not repeat the failure of the artificial organisms because they are not slaves, but warriors who command the tides.\nThe abyss may claim my body, but I still belong to Ægir.\n'Scissors.' The Consul's order is curt. Little Handy extends its other limb, and thin blades protrude from its end.\nShe holds out a lock of light golden hair and lets the blades close around it. When the surgery is complete, the blood of the Sea Born will change the color of her hair.\n'Store this for me. I will claim it back after the surgery.'","name":"Pale Gold Hair Pendant","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"30135","count":2},{"id":"4001","count":80000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":60},{"id":"30125","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":100000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":4},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":20},{"id":"30155","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":120000}]]}]},"char_475_akafyu":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Akafuyu","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30021","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30063","count":3}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30073","count":3},{"id":"30053","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":7},{"id":"30042","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3223","count":3},{"id":"31014","count":8},{"id":"30053","count":15}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_akafyu_1","icon":"skchr_akafyu_1","name":"Nobukage-ryu - Kaminari Gatana no Zei","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"30093","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":5}]]},{"id":"skchr_akafyu_2","icon":"skchr_akafyu_2","name":"Nobukage-ryu - Juumonji Masaru","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31014","count":3},{"id":"30013","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30044","count":3},{"id":"31024","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"31034","count":3}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_akafyu","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"SBL","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_akafyu","description":"Kirara glances at Akafuyu sitting in front of the TV.\n'Why are you suddenly so interested in this thing?

And she suffers alongside it.\nShe's never learned any biology, so she has no idea that insomnia is fatal for slumberfeet. If they cannot stick to their daily sixteen-hour sleep cycle, they will soon die from nervous disorders and organ failure.\nBut she is a hunter. She needs only see the tracks atop the sandy soil to understand thatthe slumberfoot cubs have lost their parents. Claw marks and bloodstains stretch from the torn-apart den to the surface, shells chafe against the undergrowth, and a set of footsteps gradually fades into the distance. It was the sandbeasts. They had a slight head-start on her and got to their prey before leaving.\nShe would rather not return empty-handed.\nShe takes a short knife from her boot, and walks towards the softly whimpering cubs, treading as quietly as she can. Her foster parents had drilled this bit of wisdom into her: everything that's managed to last in the wastes has some value. In her hands, these dying cubs would make excellent bait, whether to lure other preys into a trap, or to distract dangerous predators.\nThe stars are still bright in the sky, and the first light of dawn has yet to touch the horizon. The hunter returns to camp as she said she would, and blows a whistle. Children barely younger than her help take her crossbow bolts and snares, gleefully relieving her of her catch. They sharpen their skinning knives and cleaving axes as the rest of this small camp in the wilderness begins to swarm with activity. Furs and organs soon come together in a stream of visceral vapor that is rather hard to describe, rising up above the campfire.\nAfter a cup of hot, calming tea, the hunter returns to her tent. She feels about in front of her, then cautiously holds the warm slumberfoot cub's body. It no longer whimpers as it sleeps soundly in her arms, marked with perfectly straight black and white stripes between its eyes. This was the only surviving cub. It is strong, brave, and can secrete more of its hypnotic substance than its siblings could. The hunter knows that she and the children of the camp are far from the fairy tales of the nomadic cities, and a wanderer needs a reliable partner, not a tame and docile pet.\nShe takes out a small piece of felt and lets the cub sleep atop it, then forces her sore fingers to continue with her needlework.

Course materials for social work are strewn across his lap, all procured from the secondhand market, though he hasn't thumbed through them in a while.\nThis was never part of his life plans during middle school. He used to be praised for his talent by his Originium Arts teachers, and daydreamed of being recruited by both R&D and military firms. Of course, he also remembers not having spare money for a proper Arts Unit that met course safety standards, always using faculty equipment loaned to him by the teaching staff instead. This went on until one day a student tossed a broken staff at him in front of the rest of the class. Amidst all their jeering and laughter, he chose to silently pick it up, take it home, and spent a good week fixing it. In his mind, at the time, as long as he could lean on his exceptional talent, then the jeering from his classmates was something he could put up with.\nHe used that old staff for the next two school years. In the end, he took it apart, sold the Arts Unit—the only part that was worth anything—and then confronted the one who'd humiliated him and fought with him. He'd realized his supposed 'talent' wasn't even capable of letting him surpass those classmates with keener, smarter weapons, let alone the geniuses of his major and his professors who had the backing of experimental funding. Eliseo could almost imagine how they, just like his classmate who threw him the broken staff, would disdainfully toss him outmoded equipment, or flaunt some enviable academic achievements in front of him, all while boasting themselves as his savior.\nAnd that same afternoon, he flipped two pages back in a monthly magazine to see an Infected survivors' report from the Maylander Foundation. It occurred to him: maybe if he got into Infected social work, he wouldn't be looked down on any longer. After all, the Infected were in even worse of a position than him, and always in need.

He's going to be warned: social work requires patience first and foremost; some cases will be exceptionally tough to handle, hopefully he's mentally well-prepared for this...\nBut after Eliseo sits down at the interview desk, the professor smiles and greets him with a question.\n'Why do you want to become a social worker?'\nHe finds himself at a sudden loss for words.\nThe professor silently gazes at him for a moment, then gently speaks.

A shop awaiting customers, a damaged high-rise stretching up, a short young palm tree—these things, seemingly forever frozen in the past, warp with the rays in the warm ripple of twilight. She turns the corner, reaches to fiddle with a plank door on the silent roadside. Ash-blackened wood splinters and an ash-blackened lock fall away, throwing up dust just as ash-black as the rest of it. Through cracks in the ash peek the street's original lacquer of red and blue.\nThere's no longer a sharp protrusion to be found in this city blanketed by volcanic ash; it seems to stand forever at the other end of the young girl's dreamland. She can hardly connect the view before her eyes with the stories Grandpa used to tell her. This is where those long-gone fiery summers and crystal-clear blue sparkling waters were—somehow, it was only ever scenes like those where his younger self in the stories could stand firm with his back straight, chanting work songs and spilling sweat. Even as the stiff shoulder straps dig painfully into her body, she clutches onto her rucksack tight, hands smeared in grime.\nIt's wrong. This is wrong. No one could live in a fantasy of the past, no one could possibly keep their fervor lit forever with just memories for firewood, and no one should spend their life asleep just to go back to how it was.

She's experienced frightful desperation, the challenges of self-rejection and Oripathy, the melancholy of finding you don't stand out within the crowd—she's been through all of it.

Our hero for today is one such case.\nThe kids downtown never seem to exhaust their creativity or energy. Their skate tricks, graffiti art, and street rap hold a certain peculiar charm. No need for any means of intercity communication; it flourishes naturally in any urban center. Even the private school kids are captivated by this downtown 'ruff 'n' tuff stuff,' but discipline from their parents or teachers usually keeps them steering clear. They don't go out and experience the cool stuff for themselves.\nSo, our hero? His parents weren't for or against, they just didn't care, because our hero was a step ahead of the rest of his year. In whatever time was his own, he'd run off to hang out with those kids, but never actually joined in any of their activities. Maybe he was scared his classmates would mock him? Maybe he was scared that doing anything alongside the Infected would bring him trouble? Maybe he knew he wasn't like those kids, and in his heart raged all manner of emotions with nowhere to pour them? Who knows. All we know is that after the city passed a few new regulations quite unfriendly to the Infected, he put his self-taught knowledge to use and provided those kids some special new graffiti paints. If you ever tried to use water or any ordinary solvent to clean those walls, fresh anti-City Hall obscenities would show up over the works to disappoint you.\nYou think this story's actually veering on being interesting? Heh. Wait until I'm done. Yes, there's still more.\nYears later, those downtown kids are grown-ups now, saddled with what City Hall gave them, including the 'necessities for life' bundled along with their experimental weapons. They're on Pioneer Teams. I hear the forces they're part of took down a group of wicked barbarians like they were spraypainting across a map, opening up an ideal site for Columbia to build a nomadic city. The street culture they once also pioneered hasn't vanished since their departure, either. You could even say it's popular among all the youth of the city now, as a form of recreation.\nAnd what of our hero, you ask? He left the city, and never again encountered any graffiti from the throes of the heart, or skateboards in hand-painted livery. He found a job, and spends day in and day out either making more efficient weapons for his customers, or researching how to more efficiently destroy them.","name":"Unerasable","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"31014","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"30064","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30014","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_491_humus":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Humus","profession":"Guard","rarity":"TIER_4","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":2}],[{"id":"3301","count":2},{"id":"30061","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30012","count":2}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":3},{"id":"30093","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"30033","count":3}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":45,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":60,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3221","count":3},{"id":"30012","count":1},{"id":"30062","count":1}]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3222","count":5},{"id":"30103","count":11},{"id":"30023","count":12}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_humus_1","icon":"skchr_humus_1","name":"Solid Waste Cutting","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"31034","count":1},{"id":"30083","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"31054","count":2},{"id":"30044","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30125","count":2},{"id":"30104","count":2}]]},{"id":"skchr_humus_2","icon":"skchr_humus_2","name":"Efficient Processing","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":2},{"id":"31014","count":1},{"id":"31053","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":4},{"id":"31044","count":2},{"id":"30054","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30135","count":2},{"id":"31034","count":2}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_humus","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"REA","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_humus","description":"This is a story from when Humus just came aboard.\nHearing they'd gotten a waste processing station's foreman from the Columbian frontier, several operators from Engineering had their curiosities piqued, wanting to see if someone with that kind of work experience had any special skills.\nWhen Humus checked in at Engineering, carrying his heap of trustworthy tools, clearly used for years, everyone present had quite the scare.\nFirstly, the box used to carry them was intimidatingly huge—only someone used to rough work like Humus could carry that thing about by one hand. Secondly, aside from the usual tools was a smorgasbord of bizarrely-shaped wonders whose usages were unclear, enough to perplex anyone who saw them.\nFortunately, Humus is the type who's happy to share. Over the next few hours, Engineering's operators gained a considerable boost to their knowledge.\n'This one's a multifunction remote control, with a lot of leeway for remodeling. Just do this... this... reassemble it quickly, and it'll transform from a TV remote to an RC detonator. It's high-power, has a huge effective range, and it's a treat to use.\n'This one's basically just an average hand cranked dynamo, but with a little souped-up functionality—it can generate electricity while it threshes corn or maybe peels potatoes. We were constantly out of power at the processing station, after all, and usually we only had corn or potatoes to eat.\n'As for this sickle, I made it out of a car door I pulled off. That car was a real funny one—after it came in written off, we had to shelve it for forever because it was just too rugged, and tearing the thing apart took some massive effort. I made the sickle's form overkill enough so if I pull it out and it scares people off, then that's one less pointless fight.'\nIt so happened that moments after the conclusion of this eye-opening equipment seminar, the bell sounded for dinnertime. Completely dazed, the operators of Engineering were itching to take this out-of-the-ordinary new colleague to the canteen for the welcome party they'd set up in advance. At the table, Humus told his curious coworkers a few stories, of people and things out on the frontier that in his eyes were just everyday life. Yet it was only after his captive audience had finished taking in his stories that they realized <i>why</i> Humus had the skillset that he did.\nThe frontier's not a place you survive with just the average Joe's common sense.","name":"Badlands Exotic Toolkit","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"31023","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":20000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":15},{"id":"31043","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":25000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":1},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":5},{"id":"30033","count":6},{"id":"4001","count":30000}]]}]},"char_492_quercu":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Quercus","profession":"Supporter","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30011","count":10}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30022","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30032","count":5}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30083","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30093","count":2},{"id":"30013","count":4}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3271","count":4},{"id":"30052","count":4},{"id":"30012","count":4}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3273","count":3},{"id":"30044","count":6},{"id":"30083","count":13}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_quercu_1","icon":"skchr_quercu_1","name":"Earth's Benevolence","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30074","count":3},{"id":"30053","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31014","count":3},{"id":"30014","count":7}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30125","count":4},{"id":"30084","count":3}]]},{"id":"skchr_quercu_2","icon":"skchr_quercu_2","name":"Echo of Life","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"31053","count":2}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31024","count":3},{"id":"30104","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"30074","count":5}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_quercu","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"BLS","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_quercu","description":"20 MAR\nVia this operation, my team succeeded in establishing a contact channel out of the city.

We hear you've gone into business for yourself, and both your father and I are delighted to hear it. But you left in such a hurry, and so much was left unsaid. Since you decided to pack so light, I went ahead and sent you your old things. I wrote what I wanted to say on the item list here.\n[Half a box of matches]\nYou were three years old, trying to light a match the way the grown-ups do. You stuck the matchstick between your fingers. Your father rushed over, but you just giggled, waving your chubby little fists at him, and then the flame went out.\n[Worn-out lighter]\nSomeone gave this to you one summer before the start of school. It was broken, but you managed to actually fix it in time for the new term. Your father tried to take it several times, but seeing the excited look on your face as you spun it between your fingertips, he couldn't bring himself to do it.\n[High-end lighter]\nYou got it from Ashe before she went into the mines for the first time. You were about to go to high school in the city, and you didn't talk much with us anymore. We thought it was just a phase. But it wasn't until you came home for your eighteenth birthday that we learned Ashe had died in a mine accident and we realized we were wrong. You had a big fight with your father, and we knew things were more complicated than we'd thought.\nIt's been over a decade since then. At first, your father thought he should pass you the family business, so even if you didn't connect with us, you could still manage it in your own way, do as you would... you could even sell it! More than a business, we wanted to be able to have a heart-to-heart talk with our daughter.\nBut every time you two talked about it, you ended up fighting. And by the time you finished university, you'd lost all interest in talking to us.\n[Portable fire extinguisher]\nThis was supposed to be your eighteenth birthday present. We felt something like a sense of surrender when we settled on it. You liked playing with fire, and were pretty good at it. We accepted that, and hoped you'd always remember to quench the flames. Now it seems like we had nothing to worry about there.\nWhen you came home this time, we could see you'd grown a lot. No longer the young girl full of thoughts she couldn't express. But when we asked about your business and whether you needed help... you just smiled and said everything was fine.\nAgni, we know how stubborn you are, and how persistent, but... at least tell us about your troubles, let us offer some advice.

These fragments came from a stained glass door back home. My grandpa made for my 12th birthday, and fitted it into my greenhouse. Then later on it got destroyed in the war, but I gathered up all the fragments and brought them with me to Rhodes. I planned to just leave them around as a keepsake, but then I heard you can restore stained glass, so I'm sending them to you. Fingers crossed you can make it good as new. Whatever it costs, it doesn't matter.\nThe shards are v. sharp. I've given each a run through soap suds and wrapped them up properly, but please be careful when you get them so you don't cut your hands.\nREPLY FROM / Deepcolor:\nHello. I can tell it was damaged in war; no wonder it's covered in so much grime. I'll need some time to clean it—please wait patiently in the meanwhile.\nREPLY FROM / Operator:\nThank you so much, would it be OK to ask you to save any soil you clean off?\nI know it's dirt, but it's my home soil. I've been raising a flower from home here, growth hasn't been ideal. Maybe it will be more comfortable if I fill its flowerpot with that soil.\nREPLY FROM / Logistics Department:\nAll good. Please come pick up your package tomorrow before 12.\nREPLY FROM / Operator:\nThank you\n(attached: A daisy)\nREPLY FROM / Deepcolor:\nRestoration work went very smoothly—you kept the fragments in such remarkable shape, I hardly found any trouble piecing it all together. However, red has seeped into several pieces' cracks, which is spoiling the original design. My suggestion is substituting those with pieces of brand new glass, onto which I can paint using the original design.\nREPLY FROM / Operator:\nSorry. I'm assuming the red in there is blood I accidentally spilled on it, I thought I managed to clean it all off.\nI think I need some time to consider. Would it be OK if you paused the restoration work for the moment?\nThank you.\nREPLY FROM / Deepcolor:\nIs something the matter, Vendela? I haven't been able to contact you all this time—the glass door has been with me for almost a month now.\nREPLY FROM / Operator:\nVery sorry, Deepcolor. I took a trip home.\nAll that blood on the glass reminded me of something I hate remembering. I once had to sprint through an alley covered in blood, it dripped all over the soil and left these black marks behind, I couldn't bear to look.\nBut on my trip back, I found it blooming with deep red roses in the same alley, maybe some seeds from my pocket fell too back then, and they took up that blood as nutrients, and then they bore flowers to all the sun and rain.\nI'd like to keep that bloodstained glass. Could you repaint on top with these gorgeous flowers if that's OK? They have blood's color, and its warmth too.\n(attached: One of my roses from home, I've used Arts to keep it fresh, in hopes you'll feel the beauty of it too)","name":"Broken Rose","cost":[[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"30034","count":3},{"id":"4001","count":40000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_1","count":20},{"id":"31034","count":4},{"id":"4001","count":50000}],[{"id":"mod_unlock_token","count":2},{"id":"mod_update_token_2","count":8},{"id":"30074","count":5},{"id":"4001","count":60000}]]}]},"char_496_wildmn":{"cnOnly":false,"name":"Wild Mane","profession":"Vanguard","rarity":"TIER_5","skillLevelUpCosts":[[{"id":"3301","count":4}],[{"id":"3301","count":4},{"id":"30031","count":7}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30042","count":3}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"30052","count":4}],[{"id":"3302","count":6},{"id":"31033","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"31043","count":3},{"id":"31013","count":2}]],"promotions":[{"maxLevel":50,"evolveCost":[]},{"maxLevel":70,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3211","count":4},{"id":"30022","count":5},{"id":"30012","count":3}]},{"maxLevel":80,"evolveCost":[{"id":"3213","count":3},{"id":"31054","count":8},{"id":"30053","count":11}]}],"skills":[{"id":"skchr_wildmn_1","icon":"skchr_wildmn_1","name":"Stabbing Lance","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"31044","count":3},{"id":"31023","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30084","count":3},{"id":"31054","count":5}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30115","count":4},{"id":"31024","count":4}]]},{"id":"skchr_wildmn_2","icon":"skchr_wildmn_2","name":"Lance Charge","masteryCosts":[[{"id":"3303","count":5},{"id":"30014","count":3},{"id":"30093","count":4}],[{"id":"3303","count":6},{"id":"30094","count":3},{"id":"30074","count":6}],[{"id":"3303","count":10},{"id":"30135","count":4},{"id":"31014","count":4}]]}],"modules":[{"id":"uniequip_002_wildmn","cnOnly":false,"typeName1":"CHG","type":"X","icon":"uniequip_002_wildmn","description":"Iwona Krukowska's greatest regret is that she was unable to take the wine chalice in her room with her when she left Kazimierz.\nThat goblet forged of gold was a coming-of-age present. No child at that point in the Krukowska family was as gallant as her, and she became the knight they placed their hopes in.\nIwona was used to long-term life in the camp. Scarce on modern means of entertainment, she upheld the strictest work-rest cycle and physical training, all of it for one purpose, becoming a campaign knight—the bravest campaign knight of them all.\nTo the Krukowska family, attaining service as a campaign knight is the highest honor of them all. The ancient family defends at the borderlands, their backs to the prosperous clamor of Kazimierz's cities, facing the frostbitten winters of Ursus. Iwona grew up on stories of heroism, and grew a pure fear and longing for that dangerous, tumultuous battlefield like nothing else.\nThe day her family Knight Primus granted her the chalice, it ensured Iwona had no second thoughts. She beat pure hot blood with every pulse. She signed up to every arduous training regimen with no care for the risk, and improved herself through it. She never took notice of whatever grimy deals and nonsense slander laid behind those majestic ideals. She...\nShe ran too fast, forgot precautions were always called for in perilous circumstances, and just one negligent second would be all it took to brew a tremendous tragedy.\nIwona only forgot this one thing. Just one time.\nShe was mercilessly thrown to the ground in the open country. A lone person hurrying, a lone person wounded, a lone person helpless. Those wild beasts growing Originium crystals wailed at her in their death throes, piercing her eardrums. Those sharp Originium crystals, sent every way by the explosion, skewered a body that wouldn't move as she asked.\nMaking it on willpower until aid came running, Iwona was lucky to survive. But after that, she was thoroughly cut away from the life she used to live.\nThat chalice was placed in her display cabinet, separated by a glass door, and every time Iwona came home, she would wipe it clean.\nShe tried returning to her family afterwards, to at least see her own mother and father again one more time, go back into her room, take away some memories of hers—\nNot once more has she

He treasured his gun like nothing else, wouldn't bring it out just for anything, but one time he let Richele touch it, because he was the same as him, a Sankta.\n'Young man, you should have a gun too.'\nThe old man looked into his eyes, seeming to mean something by it, though Richele wasn't quite able to tell what.\nShould he have a gun?\nIt wasn't something he'd ever thought about.\nHe'd always been pretty much like the other kids on his street. They whiled away the time wandering about the city, scuffling every which where, doing odd jobs for the famiglie, fighting over the right to play at some machine in the arcade and calling it a 'turf war'... If that described him, should he have a gun?\n'Young man, what are you getting distracted for right now?'\nThe Sankta before him gives him a light few nudges with the gun. \n'Aren't you scared? Aren't you worried I'll pull the trigger?'\n'You're not going to, Mister. Because... um, I heard, we can't hurt our own people? Isn't that how it works?'\nBut this was just sophistry.\nThou mayst not harm thy kin. That's what the old man at church said, and he thinks that's what he meant. He has some recollection of it, but he's never paid it much mind.\nRichele carefully scrutinizes the Sankta before him. Travel-worn, but with clothes all neat and tidy, and looking in good health.\nAre he and this person kin? It's hard to say.\n'You're not wrong. We can't point guns at our own people.'\nSays the Sankta. But. There's always a but—\n'*clack*.'\nThe sound of pulling a trigger.\nRichele holds his breath in that instant, and fiercely throws himself to the side. He feels no despair at this turn of events, he simply hopes he can avoid the fatal shot, and—\n'...Whuh?'\nHe feels a faint sting on his forehead. Something falls, sweeping past the bridge of his nose, and Richele grabs it.\nIt's a piece of candy.\n'And that's to say, nice to meet you.'\nThe Sankta grins, no longer tensed up like before. He gives the prank item that spat out the candy a spin around his finger, then hands it to Richele. 'We know you from the head of the chapel. He asked if we could pick you up on our way back.'\nHe shoots Richele a wink, and says:\n'What do you think, Richele?
